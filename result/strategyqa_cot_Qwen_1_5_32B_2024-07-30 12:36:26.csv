Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?,"['Depression is caused by low levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.', 'Monoamine Oxidase breaks down neurotransmitters and lowers levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.']","First, understand the role of neurotransmitters in depression: low levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine are associated with depression. Next, consider the function of Monoamine Oxidase (MAO): it breaks down these neurotransmitters, leading to lower levels. A candy bar containing MAO would increase the activity of MAO, which in turn would decrease the levels of the neurotransmitters that are already low in a depressed person.

Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?,"['Julius Caesar had three children.', 'Genghis Khan had sixteen children.', 'Modern geneticists have determined that  out of every 200 men today has DNA that can be traced to Genghis Khan.']","First, consider the number of offspring each historical figure had: Julius Caesar had three children, while Genghis Khan had sixteen. Modern geneticists have found that approximately 1 in 200 men today carry DNA traceable to Genghis Khan, which suggests a significant number of descendants. Therefore, more people today are likely related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar due to his larger number of offspring and the spread of his genetic legacy over time.

Do the anchors on Rede Globo speak Chinese?,"['Rede Globo is a Brazilian television network.', 'The official language of Brazil is Portuguese.']","First, consider the information about Rede Globo: it is a Brazilian television network. The official language of Brazil is Portuguese. Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the anchors on a Brazilian television network would primarily speak the official language of the country, which is Portuguese. There is no specific information provided to suggest that they would need to speak Chinese as part of their duties, unless there are specific programs targeting Chinese-speaking audiences, which is not mentioned in the context.

Next, look at the box office earnings of Wonder Woman (2017 film), which grossed over 800 million dollars. Comparing these two amounts, it is clear that the film's box office receipts far exceed the cost of a single Boeing 737. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is the language used in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines rooted in English?,"['The primary language spoken in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is Vincentian Creole.', 'Vincentian Creole is English-based, with elements of French, Antillean Creole, and indigenous South American and African languages.']","First, we identify the primary language spoken in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which is Vincentian Creole. Next, we consider the origins of Vincentian Creole, described as being English-based with influences from French, Antillean Creole, and indigenous South American and African languages.

Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?,"['The members of The Police were musicians, not law enforcement officers.', 'Only law enforcement officers can perform lawful arrests.']","First, consider the roles of the members of The Police: they were musicians, not sworn law enforcement officers. Second, understand the legal authority to make arrests: only law enforcement officers are authorized to perform lawful arrests. Given that the members of The Police were not law enforcement officers, they did not have the legal authority to make arrests. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?,"['Grey seals have no ear flaps and their ears canals are filled with wax.', 'Grey seals hear better underwater when their ears open like a valve.', 'Dogs have sensitive ears that can hear as far as a quarter of a mile away.']","First, consider the hearing abilities of dogs and grey seals. Dogs have sensitive ears that can hear over long distances, while grey seals have adapted to hearing better underwater due to their ear structure. The context does not mention grey seals' response to bells, but it implies that their hearing on land might be less acute compared to dogs.

Given that dogs are often trained to respond to bells or other signals, and their hearing is generally more acute on land, it is reasonable to assume that a dog would likely respond to a bell before a grey seal, especially on land where the seal's hearing may be less effective.

Relay batons are used in relay races, which are athletic track and field events, but they were not part of the Space Race. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can you buy Casio products at Petco?,"['Casio is a manufacturer of consumer electronics and watches', 'Petco is a chain store that sells pet supplies like food, bowls, litter, toys, cages and grooming equipment']","First, consider the types of products each company offers: Casio is known for consumer electronics and watches, while Petco primarily sells pet supplies. Since Casio products are not in the category of pet supplies, it is unlikely that they would be available for purchase at Petco. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is a pound sterling valuable?,"['A pound sterling is fiat money.', 'Fiat money is backed by government decree and has no intrinsic value.', 'One pound sterling is worth about 1.24 US dollars by May of 2020.']","First, consider the context that a pound sterling is fiat money, which means it is backed by government decree and has no intrinsic value. However, its value is determined by economic factors and market forces. The context also provides a specific exchange rate of about 1.24 US dollars per pound sterling as of May 2020. While fiat money does not have the same inherent worth as, for example, gold, it is still widely accepted as a medium of exchange and holds value in the global economy.

Given that shrimp can contain microplastics, it is not guaranteed that shrimp scampi, which uses shrimp, would be completely free of plastic. The answer is 'False'.",False
Will the Albany in Georgia reach a hundred thousand occupants before the one in New York?,"['Albany, GA has around 75,000 people', 'Albany, NY has almost 100,000 people']","First, consider the current populations of the two cities: Albany, Georgia has around 75,000 people, while Albany, New York has almost 100,000 people. To determine if Albany, Georgia will reach a hundred thousand occupants before Albany, New York, we would need to analyze population growth rates, migration patterns, and other demographic factors. However, based on the current populations given, Albany, Georgia would need to grow by 25,000 people to reach 100,000, while Albany, New York would need to lose population to fall below that number. Without additional information on these factors, it's not possible to definitively say which city will reach 100,000 occupants first. The answer is 'Unknown'.",False
Are Christmas trees dissimilar to deciduous trees?,"['Christmas trees are usually pine trees.', 'Pine trees keep their needles all year round.']","First, consider the characteristics of Christmas trees, which are usually pine trees. Pine trees are an example of evergreen trees, meaning they retain their leaves (needles) throughout the year. Deciduous trees, on the other hand, lose their leaves in the fall and grow new ones in the spring. Since Christmas trees, being pine trees, do not lose their needles like deciduous trees do, they are dissimilar in this aspect.

Does Biochemistry study gluons?,"['Biochemistry studies role, function, and structure of biomolecules.', 'Gluon, the so-called messenger particle of the strong nuclear force, which binds sub-atomic particles known as quarks within the protons and neutrons of stable matter as well as within heavier, short-lived particles created at high energies.', 'biomolecules are comprised of atoms. ']","First, understand the focus of biochemistry: it studies the role, function, and structure of biomolecules. Biomolecules are composed of atoms. Gluons, on the other hand, are subatomic particles involved in the strong nuclear force, which acts at the atomic核 level but is not a component or subject of biochemistry.

Given that biochemistry deals with biomolecules and their functions within living organisms, while gluons are particles studied in the realm of particle physics and the fundamental forces of nature, biochemistry does not study gluons.

Would Nancy Pelosi publicly denounce abortion?,"['Abortion is a topic that divides the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.', 'Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat and appeals to that base.', 'The Democratic base is largely pro-choice with abortion. ']","First, consider the context: abortion is a divisive issue between the two major US political parties, with Democrats generally supporting a woman's right to choose (pro-choice) and Republicans often opposing abortion (pro-life). Nancy Pelosi is a high-ranking member of the Democratic Party and therefore represents the interests of her party's base. The Democratic base is largely supportive of abortion rights.

Given this information, it is unlikely that Nancy Pelosi, as a prominent Democrat, would publicly denounce abortion, as doing so would go against the views of her party's base. The answer is 'False'.",False
"If you were on a diet, would you have to skip lunch at McDonald's?","[""McDonald's offers low calorie brunch options like parfaits and egg white sandwiches. "", ""McDonald's offers low calorie lunch options including basic hamburgers and salads.""]","First, consider the context: McDonald's offers low calorie options for both brunch and lunch, such as parfaits, egg white sandwiches, basic hamburgers, and salads. If you were on a diet, you could choose from these lower calorie options rather than skipping lunch altogether at McDonald's. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a psychic who admits to hot reading be trustworthy?,"['Hot reading is a technique used by people presenting themselves as psychics to acquire information about a subject prior to the psychic session.', 'Hot reading is considered deception in the psychic community.']","First, understand that hot reading is a deceptive technique used by some individuals posing as psychics to gain information about a subject before the psychic session. This practice goes against the ethical principles of psychics, as it involves misleading the client by using prior knowledge rather than actual psychic abilities.
2. Since hot reading is considered deception within the psychic community, a psychic who admits to using this method is admitting to欺骗 their clients.
Answer: False.",False
Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?,"['Greed is a longing for wealth and power.', 'White collar crime involves businesses stealing money or assets from people. ', '5-10% of arrests per 100,000 arrests were for  white collar crime according to Department of Justice statistics.', 'Gluttony is the overindulgence in food or similar things.', '39.8% of US adults were classified as overweight according to the National Center for Health Statistics.']","First, we need to understand that the prevalence of a sin is not necessarily measurable in terms of arrests or percentages of a population. The Seven Deadly Sins are abstract concepts representing excessive or negative behaviors, not crimes. 

Context 3 provides information on the rate of white collar crime arrests, which might be related to greed, but it does not directly measure the prevalence of the sin itself among the general population. 

Context 5 gives a statistic on the percentage of overweight adults in the US, which could be related to gluttony, but again, this does not measure the prevalence of the sin compared to others.

Without direct measures of the prevalence of each of the Seven Deadly Sins, it is not possible to definitively say that greed is the most prevalent. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a student of the class of 2017 have amnesia about 9/11?,"['Childhood amnesia is common, with most adults not remembering their lives before 2 or 3 years of age', '9/11 occurred in 2001', 'Students graduating high-school in 2017 would have been born in 1999']","First, consider the age of a student graduating high school in 2017. They would have been born in 1999. Childhood amnesia typically affects memories before the age of 2 or 3. 9/11 occurred in 2001, which means that a child born in 1999 would have been around 2 years old at the time. Given the nature of childhood amnesia, it is likely that a student from the class of 2017 would not have vivid memories of 9/11.

Next, look at the age range of students accepted at Camden Military Academy: they accept male students in grades 7 through 12. Since kindergarten is not within the accepted grade range and the academy is for male students only, The Powerpuff Girls, who are female kindergarten students, could not attend Camden Military Academy. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does actress Leila George lack the height to be a model?,"['Actress Leila George, the daughter of Vincent D\'onofrio, is 5\'9"" tall.', 'Model Cindy Crawford is 5\'9"" tall.', 'Model Agyness Deyn is 5\'8"" tall.', 'Model Sara Sampaio is 5\'8"" tall.']","First, consider the typical height requirement for models. While there is no strict height requirement, most runway models are generally between 5'9"" and 6'0"" tall. Leila George is 5'9"", which is within this range. Comparing her height to that of established models like Cindy Crawford (also 5'9"") shows that she is of a similar stature. Models like Agyness Deyn and Sara Sampaio, who are both 5'8"", are slightly shorter but still work as successful models.

Given that Leila George is 5'9"" and this is within the typical height range for models, it would not be accurate to say that she lacks the height to be a model. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would the top of Mount Fuji stick out of the Sea of Japan? ,"['The average depth of the Sea of Japan is  5,748 feet (1,752 metres) and its maximum depth is 12,276 feet (3,742 metres)', 'Mount Fuji is 3,776.24 metres (12,389.2 ft) tall.

In contrast, insured individuals typically have their CT scans covered or partially covered by their insurance company. Given the significant financial burden a CT scan would impose on an uninsured person, they would likely be more cautious about undergoing the procedure due to the cost.

According to the context, Disney World in Florida is larger than both Disneyland Paris Resort and Disneyland California Resort combined. Since Disneyland Paris only contains two parks, several hotels, and a shopping district, while Disney World has four parks, two waterparks, and many more hotels, it is clear that Disney World is the larger resort. The answer is 'False'.",False

Second, recognize that the standard keyboard layout is optimized for individuals without such challenges. Third, acknowledge that there are alternative keyboard layouts designed to accommodate various disabilities.

Considering these points, it is logical to conclude that someone with fine motor control issues might find an altered keyboard layout more suitable and easier to use, as it would be designed to address their specific needs. The answer is 'True'.",True

Would a broadcast from Spirit make the news in 2020?,"['In 2010, the Spirit rover sent what is recorded as its final transmission.', 'In 2019, another rover made the news with its viral ""final words""']","First, consider the context: Spirit rover sent its final transmission in 2010, and it has been inactive since then. In 2019, a different rover made news with its ""final words,"" suggesting that rover-related news can still capture attention. However, since Spirit is no longer operational and its last communication was a decade ago, a new broadcast from it in 2020 would be an extraordinary and unexpected event.

Given the historical significance of the Spirit rover and the fact that it would imply some sort of miraculous resurrection or contact with a long-lost spacecraft, such an occurrence would likely be considered newsworthy. The answer is 'True'.",True

Next, note that a Dolce & Gabbana suit, specifically the Two Tone variety, features several buttons. Given the Amish prohibition on buttons and their practice of shunning those who violate their religious norms, it is likely that an individual wearing a Dolce & Gabbana suit, with its buttons, would be seen as not adhering to Amish dress codes and could potentially be shunned by their Amish cousins.

Would it be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition?,"['The Iwato scale has 5 pitch cases.', 'The chromatic scale has 12 pitch cases.']","First, understand the key points: the Iwato scale has 5 pitch cases, while the chromatic scale has 12 pitch cases. The twelve-tone technique requires a composer to use all 12 pitch cases of the chromatic scale without repetition within a composition.

Since the Iwato scale has only 5 pitch cases, it does not contain the full range of pitch cases required for a twelve-tone technique composition, which necessitates the use of all 12 pitch cases.

Could a dandelion suffer from hepatitis?,"['Only creatures that contain a liver can suffer from hepatitis.', 'The liver is an organ only found in vertebrates.', 'Vertebrates exist in the kingdom Animalia.', 'Dandelions are plants in the kingdom Plantae.']","First, understand that hepatitis is a disease that affects the liver. According to the context, only creatures with a liver can suffer from hepatitis. The liver is an organ found only in vertebrates, which are animals in the kingdom Animalia. Dandelions, on the other hand, are plants in the kingdom Plantae. Plants do not have a liver or any similar organ.

Can a strawberry get worms similar to dogs?,"['Strawberry can suffer from black root rot and nematodes.', 'Dogs can suffer from a variety of worms including roundworms that lay eggs on them.', 'Nematodes are parasites that are also called roundworms and ascarids.', 'Nematodes are parasites that feed off of strawberry plants.']","First, identify the relevant information: strawberries can suffer from nematodes, which are a type of roundworm. Dogs can also suffer from roundworms, but the context specifies that these worms lay eggs on dogs, not affecting them in the same way as plant parasites. Nematodes, as mentioned, are both parasites that affect strawberries and a type of roundworm.

Conclusion: While the roundworms that affect dogs are not the same as the nematodes that affect strawberries, both are types of roundworms. The context does not specify if the roundworms that affect dogs could hypothetically infect strawberries under any circumstances, but since nematodes (a type of roundworm) do infect strawberries, it is not entirely implausible for some other type of roundworm to potentially affect strawberries in a different way.

The answer is 'True', considering that a broad category of worms called roundworms can be parasites to both strawberries and dogs, even if the specific species causing problems are different.",True
Was the Louisiana Purchase made with bitcoin?,"['Bitcoin was launched as a currency in 2009.', 'The Louisiana Purchase was in 1803.']","The Louisiana Purchase was made in 1803, while Bitcoin was launched as a currency in 2009. Since Bitcoin did not exist at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, it could not have been used in that transaction. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a Pict be confused by Old English?,"['Old English was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, a Germanic tribe that inhabited England.', 'The Picts were a Celtic-speaking people that lived in what is now Scotland.', 'The Pictish language died out by 1100AD and was replaced by Gaelic.', 'Gaelic and Old English are completely different languages from different branches of the Indo-European language family.', 'Gaelic vocabulary is very different from Old English  and verbs are also conjugated differently.']","First, understand that Old English and the Pictish language are from different language families: Old English is Germanic while Pictish is Celtic. Second, note that the Pictish language had died out by 1100 AD, which is before the period when Old English was being spoken. Given that they spoke different languages and the Pictish language is extinct, a Pict would not be able to understand Old English. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would a week be enough time to watch every episode of Ugly Betty?,"['There are 168 hours in a week.', 'The entire Ugly Betty series is 85 hours long.']","First, calculate the total time available in a week to watch TV, which is 168 hours. Next, consider the total duration of the Ugly Betty series, which is 85 hours. If we divide the total time in a week by the length of the series, we get 168 hours / 85 hours = approximately 1.98 weeks. Since a week is 7 days and there are 24 hours in a day, 1.98 weeks would be slightly more than 1 week but less than 2 weeks. Therefore, a week would be almost enough to watch every episode of Ugly Betty, but not quite sufficient to finish it within the week without any breaks. The answer is 'False'.",True
Did any country in Portuguese Colonial War share Switzerlands role in WWII?,"[""The Portuguese Colonial War was between Portugal and several groups including People's Movement for Liberation of Angola."", 'Switzerland remained neutral in World War II and did not get involved.', 'Portugal stayed out of world affairs during World War II.']","First, we establish that Switzerland's role in WWII was to remain neutral and not participate in the conflict. Next, we look at the context of the Portuguese Colonial War, which was a conflict between Portugal and independence movements in its African colonies, such as Angola. The context also mentions that Portugal stayed out of world affairs during WWII.

Since the question asks if any country in the Portuguese Colonial War shared Switzerland's role in WWII, we need to find out if any of the countries involved were neutral like Switzerland during the war. However, the context provided does not mention the neutrality of any countries involved in the Portuguese Colonial War.

Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine if any country in the Portuguese Colonial War shared Switzerland's role in WWII. The answer is 'False'.",True
Could Lil Wayne's children ride in a Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 together?,"['Lil Wayne has four children.', 'A Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 has 2 seats.']","First, consider the number of Lil Wayne's children, which is four. Next, consider the seating capacity of a Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, which is two seats. Since there are four children and the car can only accommodate two passengers, they could not all ride together in the Corvette ZR1. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would the Titanic be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland?,"[""The bottom of the gulf is one of the world's largest ship cemeteries. Because of the low salinity and cold waters, and no shipworms, the ships are relatively well preserved."", 'RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship.']","First, consider the conditions at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland: it is known for having low salinity and cold waters, which contribute to the preservation of ships. Additionally, there are no shipworms in the area, which further aids in preservation.
Second, note that the RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship. Its location is not relevant to the question, as the inquiry is about preservation conditions, not the Titanic's specific location.

Given that the conditions in the Gulf of Finland are conducive to preserving ships, and considering that the Titanic would be subject to these same conditions if it were at the bottom of the gulf, it would likely be well preserved.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Is the best tasting part of the papaya in the center?,"['The center of a papaya contains a cluster of seeds.', 'Papaya seeds, while edible, are often discarded for the soft flesh that surrounds them.']","First, consider the context: the center of a papaya contains seeds, which are often discarded. The flesh surrounding the seeds is the part of the fruit that is typically eaten. Since the seeds are usually not considered the primary part of the papaya consumed for its taste, and the flesh is the main edible component, it can be inferred that the best tasting part of the papaya is not in the center.

Next, we know that a driver's license is required to legally operate a vehicle in the USA. The eligible age to obtain a driver's license varies by state, with the youngest being 14 years and three months in South Dakota. Since Lil Wayne was only 12 when his career started, he would not have been old enough to meet the minimum age requirement for a driver's license in any state at that time.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?,"['Serfs in Medieval England were peasants that were indentured servants to their lords.', 'Serfs were often harshly treated and had little legal redress against the actions of their lords.', 'Japanese serfs were farmers and fishermen.', 'Japanese believed that serfs produced food, which was depended on by all classes, therefore, they worked harder.']","First, consider the status of serfs in Medieval England: they were peasants who were essentially bound to the land and the service of their lords, with limited rights and protections.
Next, consider the status of Japanese serfs: they were farmers and fishermen who, according to Japanese belief, played a crucial role in society by producing food for all classes. This recognition of their importance might have led to a greater level of respect or consideration.

Comparing the two, while both groups were considered lower classes, the Japanese serfs' role in food production might have given them a slightly higher perceived value within their society. However, without specific information on treatment, legal rights, or social standing that directly compares the two systems, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment.

The answer is 'Uncertain' due to the lack of direct comparative data on the treatment and status within their respective societies.",True
Could an ocelot subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day?,"['An ocelot requires 600–800 grams (21–28 oz) of food every day to satisfy its energy requirements.', 'Bee hummingbirds are the smallest living birds, with an average weight of around 2-3 grams.']","First, consider the daily food requirements of an ocelot, which is around 600-800 grams (21-28 oz). Next, consider the weight of a bee hummingbird, which is only about 2-3 grams. Comparing these two quantities, it is clear that a single bee hummingbird provides a significantly smaller amount of food than an ocelot needs to consume daily to meet its energy requirements.

Second, understand the effects of smoking on the lungs: smoking tobacco damages the lungs and significantly increases the risk of lung cancer. Given that J. P. Morgan smoked heavily, it is likely that his lungs were damaged due to his smoking habit. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was the original James Bond actor born near the Washington Monument?,"['The original James Bond actor was Sean Connery.', 'Sean Connery was born in Scotland.', 'The Washington Monument is located in Washington, D.C.', 'Washington, D.C. and Scotland are nearly 3,500 miles apart.']","First, identify the relevant information: Sean Connery, the original James Bond actor, was born in Scotland, while the Washington Monument is located in Washington, D.C. Next, consider the distance between the two places: Washington, D.C. and Scotland are nearly 3,500 miles apart. Since Sean Connery was born in Scotland and not near the Washington Monument, which is in a completely different country, the answer is 'False'.",False
Would Firefighters be included in a September 11th memorial?,"['September 11th is remembered as a day of mourning for the lives lost during a terrorist attack in NYC.', 'Firefighters were among the first responders to the crisis, and many died.

Does Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint?,"['Alexander Nevsky was a Prince of Novgorod that fought against German and Swiss Invaders.', 'The Russian Orthodox Church named Alexander Nevsky.a saint in 1547.', 'The Russian Orthodox Church is a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church and has their own list of saints.', 'The Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have been in a state of official schism since the East–West Schism of 1054.', 'The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is a branch of the Catholic Church.']","First, we establish that Alexander Nevsky is recognized as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church. However, the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have been in schism since 1054, which means they have separate hierarchies and decision-making processes, including regarding saints.

Next, we know that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is a branch of the Catholic Church. Since the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church maintain their own lists of saints and do not necessarily recognize each other's saints, it is unlikely that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church would automatically recognize a saint from the Eastern Orthodox tradition without a specific decision to do so.

Given the historical context and the current ecclesiastical arrangement, it is reasonable to assume that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church might not automatically recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint, as they follow the Catholic tradition rather than the Orthodox one.

Does Northern fur seal make good pet for six year old?,"['An average six year old weighs 45 pounds.', 'An adult Northern fur seal can weigh up to 120 pounds.', 'Northern fur seals have sharp canine teeth for tearing.', 'Northern fur seals live near rivers to feed off of fish populations.']","First, consider the weight difference between an average six-year-old and an adult Northern fur seal: a six-year-old weighs 45 pounds, while a Northern fur seal can weigh up to 120 pounds. This significant size difference could make the animal difficult for a child to handle safely.
Second, consider the natural behavior and physical characteristics of Northern fur seals: they have sharp canine teeth for tearing, which could pose a risk to a young child.
Lastly, Northern fur seals are wild animals that typically live near rivers to feed off fish populations, not as domesticated pets.

Given these points, it would not be safe or appropriate to have a Northern fur seal as a pet for a six-year-old child. The answer is 'False'.",False

Will Tokyo Tower be repainted only once during President Trump's first term?,"['Tokyo Tower is repainted every five years ', 'The last repainting began in 2018', ""Trump's first presidential term is from 2017 to 2021""]","First, determine when the next repainting of Tokyo Tower is scheduled to take place. Since it is repainted every five years and the last repainting began in 2018, the next one would be in 2023. Next, consider the duration of President Trump's first term, which is from 2017 to 2021. Since the repainting will occur in 2023, it will not happen during his first term. The answer is 'False'.",True
Can Clouded leopards chase down many Pronghorn antelopes?,"['The top speed of a Clouded leopard is 40 MPH.', 'The top speed of a Pronghorn antelope is 61 MPH.']","First, consider the top speeds of both animals: Clouded leopards can run up to 40 MPH, while Pronghorn antelopes can run up to 61 MPH. Given that the Pronghorn antelope has a significantly higher top speed than the Clouded leopard, it is unlikely that the leopard would be able to catch up and successfully chase down many Pronghorn antelopes. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would George Fox support stoning?,"['George Fox was the founder of the Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as the Quakers or Friends.', 'The Quakers advocate for peace and nonviolence.', 'Stoning is a particularly violent and brutal method of capital punishment.']","First, consider the beliefs of the Religious Society of Friends, founded by George Fox: they are known as the Quakers and advocate for peace and nonviolence. Next, recognize that stoning is a form of capital punishment involving the throwing of stones at a person until they die, which is inherently violent and brutal. Given the Quakers' commitment to nonviolence, it is unlikely that George Fox, as the founder of the group, would support such a practice. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Clark Gable appear in any movies scored by John Williams?,"['Clark Gable died in 1960.', 'John Williams scored his first movie in 1961.']","First, note the years of significance: Clark Gable died in 1960, and John Williams scored his first movie in 1961. Since Gable died before Williams began composing film scores, Gable could not have appeared in any movies scored by Williams. The answer is 'False'.",False

Karate, as mentioned, involves various striking techniques that can be used for self-defense. Given her expertise in this martial art, it is reasonable to assume that Tove Torvalds is capable of physically defending herself. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does the anatomy of a camel lend itself to jokes on Wednesdays?,"[""Wednesday is often referred to as 'hump day' as a joke."", 'Camels are known for having a significant hump. ']","First, understand the context: Wednesday is commonly referred to as 'hump day' in casual conversation as a lighthearted play on words, alluding to the mid-week struggle and the shape of a camel's hump. Camels are indeed known for their distinct hump, which stores fat and can be a source of humor in connection with the term 'hump day.' Given that the association between camels and humps is the basis for the joke, it can be said that the anatomy of a camel does lend itself to jokes on Wednesdays.

Answer: True.",True
Can voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny each get one stripe from American flag?,"['The American flag has 13 stripes on it.', 'Since the role originated in 1932, six people have voiced the character of Goofy.', 'Since 1940, seven people have voiced the character of Bugs Bunny.']","First, we need to determine the total number of voice actors for both Goofy and Bugs Bunny combined. For Goofy, there have been six people, and for Bugs Bunny, there have been seven people. Adding these together gives us a total of 6 + 7 = 13 voice actors. The American flag has 13 stripes, which matches the number of voice actors. Each voice actor could, in theory, be associated with one stripe on the flag.

Did Eric Clapton have similar taste in women to one of the Beatles?,"['The Beatles consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.', 'George Harrison was married to Pattie Boyd from 1966-1977.', 'Eric Clapton married Pattie Boyd in 1979.']","First, identify the common factor in the context: Pattie Boyd was married to both George Harrison of the Beatles and Eric Clapton. The question asks if Eric Clapton had similar taste in women to one of the Beatles, which can be inferred from the fact that he married someone who was previously married to a Beatle.

Answer: True.",True
Did Eddie Murphy's father see his first stand up show?,"[""Eddie Murphy's father died when Eddie Murphy was 8 years old."", ""Eddie Murphy's stand up career began when he was 15 years old.""]","First, note the ages at which significant events occurred: Eddie Murphy's father died when Eddie was 8 years old, and Eddie began his stand-up career at 15. Since Eddie's father passed away before Eddie started doing stand-up comedy, it is not possible for him to have seen his son's first stand-up show. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was Donald Trump the target of Islamophobia?,"['Islamophobia targets Muslims', 'Donald Trump is a Presbyterian, a denomination of Christianity']","First, understand that Islamophobia refers to prejudice or discrimination against Muslims. According to the context, Donald Trump is identified as a Presbyterian, which is a Christian denomination. Therefore, he is not a Muslim. Since Islamophobia targets Muslims and Trump is not one, he was not the target of Islamophobia based on that definition. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is watching  Star Wars necessary to know who Darth Vader is?,"['Star Wars is one of the most widely parodied film series to be produced.', 'Star Wars merchandise, from tees to Halloween costumes, is widely available and is plentiful. ']","First, consider the context: Star Wars is a highly popular and well-known film series, and Darth Vader is a central character within it. The films have been widely parodied and the franchise has a vast amount of merchandise, indicating broad cultural exposure to the characters.

While watching the entire Star Wars film series might provide the most comprehensive understanding of Darth Vader's story and significance, his character has become so iconic that knowledge of him has permeated popular culture beyond the films. Many people are familiar with Darth Vader through references in other media, parodies, merchandise, or general cultural conversations.

Therefore, it is not strictly necessary to watch Star Wars to know who Darth Vader is, as his image and story have become widely recognized symbols in popular culture.

Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?,"['The width of the Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet. ', ""A baker's dozen includes 13 items."", 'The width of a Mac truck is around 8 feet.']","First, calculate the total width of a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks by multiplying the number of trucks by the width of one truck: 13 trucks * 8 feet/truck = 104 feet.
Next, compare the total width of the trucks to the width of the Golden Gate Bridge: 104 feet (total width of trucks) compared to 90 feet (width of the bridge).
Since the total width of the baker's dozen of Mac Trucks is greater than the width of the Golden Gate Bridge, they would indeed jam up the bridge if parked side by side. The answer is 'True'.",True
Are there winged statuettes in the home of the creator of Law & Order?,"['Law & Order was created by Dick Wolf', 'Dick Wolf won an Emmy in 2007 ', 'Dick Wolf won an Emmy in 1997', 'The Emmy statuette is of a winged woman holding an atom']","First, we establish that Dick Wolf is the creator of Law & Order. The context does not directly mention any winged statuettes in his home, but it does mention that he has won Emmys. The Emmy statuette, as described, is indeed winged, representing the winged goddess of victory, Nike.

However, winning an Emmy does not automatically mean that the statuettes are displayed in his home. People may choose to keep their awards elsewhere or display them in a different location. Without specific information about the display of his Emmy awards in his home, we cannot definitively conclude that there are winged statuettes there.

The answer is 'False', but with the note that this is an assumption based on the lack of information about the display of Dick Wolf's Emmy awards in his home.",True
Could a silverfish reach the top of the Empire State Building?,"['Silverfish cannot fly.', 'Animals that cannot fly can only access objects at or near ground level without mechanical assistance.', 'The top of the Empire State Building is \t1,454 ft high.']","First, consider the abilities of silverfish: they cannot fly. Next, understand the general limitation for animals without flight: they can only access objects at or near ground level without mechanical assistance. Given the height of the Empire State Building at 1,454 ft, it is clear that silverfish, lacking any means of flight or mechanical assistance, would be unable to reach the top. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do guitarist's have fingers that can handle pain better than average?,"['Guitarists typically have calloused fingertips. ', 'Callouses are formed of layers of dead skin and usually lack sensation.']","First, consider the context: guitarists develop callouses on their fingertips from regular contact with the guitar strings. Callouses are a protective response to repeated friction and pressure, and they do tend to reduce sensitivity in that area.
Answer: Guitarists may have a higher tolerance for pain on their fingertips due to the callouses, which have reduced sensation. However, this is specific to the fingertips and might not necessarily mean they have a greater overall pain tolerance compared to the average person. The answer is 'Partially True', as it pertains only to the calloused fingertips and not their general pain tolerance.",True
Could someone mistake the smell of your brussels sprouts for a fart?,"['Brussels Sprouts are cruciferous vegetables.', 'Cruciferous vegetables have a sulfur containing chemical called glucosinolate in them', 'When you cook brussels sprouts, their smell intensifies. ']","First, consider the properties of Brussels sprouts: they are cruciferous vegetables, which contain a sulfur-containing chemical called glucosinolate. When cooked, this chemical can cause the smell of Brussels sprouts to intensify. Now, the smell associated with Brussels sprouts can be strong and distinct, similar to the smell produced by certain bodily functions like flatulence.

Given that the smell of cooked Brussels sprouts can be quite pungent and might resemble the smell of a fart to some people, it is plausible that someone could mistake the smell of Brussels sprouts for a fart, especially in a situation where the source of the smell is not immediately apparent.

"Were there under 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965?","['In 1965 the president announced an intention to increase the amount of troops to 125,000', 'There were only 75,000 prior to 1965']","First, consider the number of American troops in Vietnam before 1965, which was 75,000. Then, look at the president's intention for troop increase in 1965, which was to reach 125,000 troops. Since the intention was to increase the number to 125,000 and there were already 75,000 troops present, it implies that there would be exactly 125,000 troops after the increase, not under 150,000. The answer is 'False'.",True
Did Native American tribes teach Spaniards how to cultivate maize?,"['In 1492, Spanish settlers brought Maize back to Europe from America.', 'Native Americans cultivated and bred the first maize from wild grasses.']","First, understand that maize (corn) originated in the Americas and was cultivated by Native American tribes long before the arrival of Europeans. In 1492, when Spanish settlers arrived in the Americas, they encountered this crop and later introduced it to Europe. Given that the Native Americans were the ones who domesticated and cultivated maize, it is logical to infer that they would have shared their knowledge with the Spanish settlers.

Next, we note that Dorian Gray appears in the Penny Dreadful episode ""Seance,"" where he flirts with Vanessa Ives. Then, we establish that Vanessa Ives is a character played by Eva Green. Therefore, Oscar Wilde's most famous character, Dorian Gray, has indeed been in an Eva Green project (Penny Dreadful). The answer is 'True'.",True
Do frogs feel disgust?,"['Disgust is a basic emotion.', 'Frogs make sounds that express their emotions.']","First, understand that disgust is listed as a basic emotion. Second, note that frogs are capable of expressing emotions through sounds. However, the context does not specify whether frogs are capable of feeling complex emotions like disgust or if their sounds merely correspond to more basic feelings. Without specific evidence of frogs experiencing disgust, we cannot definitively conclude that they do. The answer is 'False'.",True
Does a person need to be a parent to become a grandparent?,"['Parents care for their children.', 'When the children grow up and have kids of their own, the parents become grandparents to those kids.', 'A person who is not a parent has no kids, therefore nobody to produce grandchildren for them.']","First, understand the relationship described in the context: parents become grandparents when their children have children of their own. The term ""grandparent"" refers to the parent of one's own child. If a person is not a parent, they do not have any children who can have kids to make them a grandparent.

Next, we consider Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan's grandfather: he had six wives and over 500 concubines, also suggesting he did not practice monogamy. Since neither Kublai Khan nor his grandfather, Genghis Khan, had only one spouse and had multiple concubines, they both engaged in polygamy. The answer is 'False'.",False

Would Eminem perform well at the International Mathematical Olympiad?,"['Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17 and disliked math and social studies.', 'Mathematics competitions or mathematical olympiads are competitive events where participants sit a mathematics test.', 'The content on the International Mathematical Olympiad ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered at school and often not at university level either.']","First, consider Eminem's educational background and his stated disliking for math. He dropped out of high school and did not enjoy math or social studies. Second, understand the nature of the International Mathematical Olympiad, which features extremely difficult problems, including those not typically covered in school or even university level mathematics. Given Eminem's lack of formal education in advanced mathematics and his stated disinterest in the subject, it is unlikely that he would perform well at such a competition. The answer is 'False'.",False

Ariana Grande experienced a traumatic event in 2017 when a bombing occurred during her concert in Manchester, and she has publicly discussed her PTSD related to this event. Given that her experience is directly related to the subject of PTSD, her discussion could provide a personal perspective or example of how individuals can develop PTSD after a traumatic event.

An average third grader is 8 years old, which falls within the recommended age range. Next, consider the content of The Beatles' music, which is generally considered family-friendly and radio-friendly. There are no explicit lyrics or mature themes that would make the game inappropriate for an 8-year-old.

Given that the game is age-appropriate according to its recommendation and the content of the music is suitable for children, it would not be considered inappropriate for a US third grader. The answer is 'False'.",False

The Atlantic was founded in 1857 and is still publishing as of May 2020. The 1980 Summer Olympics, known as the XXII Olympiad, took place in 1980. Since The Atlantic was already in publication for over a century before the 1980 Olympics, it would have been available to read during that time.

The context tells us that Elvis Presley enjoyed peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Bananas come from banana plants, and peanut butter comes from peanuts, which also grow on plants.

Since both bananas and peanuts are products of plants, and these are the main components of Elvis Presley's snack, it is accurate to say that plants were crucial for his snack with bananas.

Additionally, his image is frequently used as a graphic on t-shirts targeted at smokers, which may also be sold in these establishments. Given the association of Bob Marley with cannabis culture and the items typically sold in smoke shops, it is likely that one could find his face there. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would it be typical for a Rede Globo anchor to say Konnichiwa to the viewers?,"['Konnichiwa is a greeting in the Japanese language.', 'The national language of Brazil is Portuguese.']","First, consider the context: Rede Globo is a Brazilian television network, and the national language of Brazil is Portuguese. Therefore, it would be expected for an anchor on Rede Globo to use Portuguese when addressing the viewers. Konnichiwa is a greeting in Japanese, not Portuguese. Thus, it would not be typical for a Rede Globo anchor to use this Japanese term in their broadcast.

Is week old chlorine water safe to drink?,"['Chlorine is a chemical that is the second lightest halogen element.', 'Chlorine is toxic and can attack the respiratory system of humans.', 'Chlorine is highly soluble in water and will dissolve in around 4 and a half days.', 'The Water Quality and Health Council states that chlorination of drinking water protects consumers from diseases caused by waterborne microorganisms.']","First, consider the context that chlorine is toxic and can attack the respiratory system. However, it is also mentioned that chlorination is used to disinfect drinking water and protect consumers from waterborne diseases. The context further states that chlorine is highly soluble in water and will dissolve in around 4 and a half days. 

Given this information, if the chlorine water has been allowed to sit for a week, it is likely that most of the chlorine has dissipated since its typical dissolving time is less than that. Assuming no new chlorine has been added during this period, the water would have had time to reduce its chlorine levels to a safer level.

The answer is 'True', assuming the water has not been rechlorinated during the week and has been stored properly. It's important to note that while the remaining levels of chlorine may be safe, it might not be ideal for drinking due to taste or potential chemical reactions with other substances in the water. For potable water, it's always best to follow local guidelines and treatment recommendations.",True
Could someone theoretically use an armadillo as a shield?,"['Armadillos have hard armor made of dermal bone.', ""Humans have ended up in the hospital due to bullets ricocheting against an armadillo's shell.""]","First, consider the armor of an armadillo: it is made of hard dermal bone, which could potentially provide some protection from projectiles or other impacts. However, context 2 mentions that bullets have ricocheted off an armadillo's shell, causing harm to humans rather than fully protecting them. This suggests that the armor might not be effective against all types of threats or at all angles.

Given the hard armor, an armadillo could theoretically provide some level of protection as a shield in certain situations, but the risk of injury from ricochets or inadequate coverage exists. The answer is 'True' with the understanding that using an armadillo as a shield carries risks and may not be a reliable form of protection in all circumstances.",True

Bombyx mori is indeed well known for its silk production, but the context states that other organisms like spiders, beetles, caterpillars, and fleas also produce silk. Additionally, wild silk from caterpillars has been used historically in various regions. This indicates that there is not an exclusive supply of silk coming from Bombyx mori.

Since 2020 is a leap year and the next one is in 2024, we add four years to his current age of 80. Chuck Norris will be 84 years old in 2024.

Now, consider the definition of a nonagenarian: a person between 90 and 99 years of age. Since Chuck Norris will be 84 in 2024, he will not be in the nonagenarian age range.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Is polyamory allowed in the Catholic Church?,"['A central tenet of the Catholic Church is a one-to-one match between man and woman.', 'The ten commandments claim that ""coveting your neighbors wife"" is a sin.']","First, consider the central tenets of the Catholic Church, which include the belief in a one-to-one match between a man and a woman in marriage. This is consistent with the traditional view of monogamy. Second, recall that the Ten Commandments, which are considered authoritative in Catholicism, include the prohibition against coveting your neighbor's wife, which implies an expectation of fidelity within a monogamous relationship. Given these teachings, polyamory, which involves consensual relationships with more than one romantic partner, is not in line with Catholic doctrine.

Do Jews believe in any New Testament angels?,"['The New Testament is a book central to Christianity.', 'The New Testament features a number of angels including Michael, and Gabriel.', 'The Talmud is the central text of Rabbinic Judaism.', ""The Talmud names four angels who would later be known as archangels, surrounding God's throne: Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael.""]","First, consider the religious beliefs of Jews: they base their faith on the Hebrew Bible (also known as the Old Testament for Christians). The New Testament is part of the Christian canon, not the Jewish one.
Next, recognize that while both the New Testament and the Talmud mention angels like Michael and Gabriel, the context in which they are discussed is different. The Talmud, a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, lists four angels including Michael and Gabriel, but does not refer to them as part of the New Testament narrative.

Since Jews base their beliefs on the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud, and the New Testament is not a part of their scriptural canon, Jews do not specifically believe in the New Testament angels within the Christian context in which they are presented.

Did Evander Holyfield compete in an Olympics hosted in the western hemisphere?,"['Evander Holyfield won a bronze medal during the 1984 Summer Olympics.', 'The 1984 Olympics were held in Los Angeles, California.', 'California is in the United States, which is located entirely within the western hemisphere.']","First, we establish that Evander Holyfield won a bronze medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. Next, we know that the 1984 Olympics took place in Los Angeles, California. California is part of the United States, and the United States is situated entirely within the western hemisphere. Therefore, since the 1984 Olympics were held in the western hemisphere and Evander Holyfield competed in those games, the answer is 'True'.",True
Does handedness determine how you use American Sign Language?,"['Your dominant hand typically performs the moving part of a sign in ASL.', 'Your dominant hand determines the hand you use to finger spell in ASL.']","First, understand the context: In American Sign Language (ASL), the dominant hand typically carries out the primary movement of a sign, and it is also used for finger spelling. Given that handedness influences these aspects of signing, it is logical to conclude that your dominant hand would play a significant role in how you use ASL.

Did Harry Houdini's wife make psychics look foolish?,"['Psychics are people that claim to have special powers to talk to the dead.', 'Harry Houdini gave his wife a code word to ask psychics to repeat after his death.', 'The wife of Harry Houdini, Wilhelmina Beatrice ""Bess"" Rahner, asked several psychics for the code word and none knew it.']","First, understand the context: Harry Houdini gave his wife a secret code word to be used as a test for真假 psychics after his death. Bess Houdini asked multiple psychics for this code word, and they were unable to provide it.

Given this information, it can be concluded that the psychics she approached failed to demonstrate their claimed ability to communicate with the dead, as they could not provide the agreed-upon code word. By doing so, they appeared unable to fulfill the claims of their psychic abilities, which might be seen as foolish in the context of their profession.

"Could the main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" join a Masonic Lodge?","['The main character of ""Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland"" is Alice, a young girl.', 'Masonic Lodge membership is restricted to men over the age of either 18 or 21, depending on jurisdiction.']","First, consider the main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"": Alice is a young girl. Next, consider the requirements for joining a Masonic Lodge: membership is restricted to men over the age of either 18 or 21, depending on jurisdiction. Since Alice is a young girl and not a man, she would not meet the gender requirement, and thus could not join a Masonic Lodge. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, consider the birth years for Generation Y, which range from 1980 to 1994. If we assume the present year is 2023, a person born in 1980 would be 43 years old, and someone born in 1994 would be 29 years old. Since the minimum age requirement is 21, all members of Generation Y born between 1980 and 1994 would be at least 21 years old or older in 2023.

There is no mention of educational grade level being a requirement for getting a driver's license. Driver's education classes can be taken in high school, but they are not explicitly tied to a specific grade like eleventh grade. Additionally, these classes can also be taken outside of high school.

Did King James I despise fairy beings?,"['King James I wrote Daemonologie in which he stated that a fairy was a being that could act as a familiar.', 'A familiar was an animal or spirit that conspired with The Devil.', 'King James I presided over the execution of Agnes Sampson.', 'Agnes Sampson was accused of conspiring with familiars and was burned at the stake.']","First, we know that King James I wrote a book called Daemonologie, in which he discussed fairies as beings that could act as familiars. Familiars, according to his belief, were creatures that conspired with the Devil. This indicates that he viewed fairies in a negative light, associating them with evil.

Second, King James I was involved in the execution of Agnes Sampson. She was accused of conspiring with familiars, which aligns with his belief system that such creatures were malicious.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that King James I did not have a favorable view of fairy beings, as he connected them to demonic activity and contributed to the punishment of someone accused of dealing with such entities.

Are moose used for work near the kingdom of Arendelle?,"[""The opening scene of Disney's Frozen shows a group of ice breakers."", 'They have moose that carry the heavy ice blocks.', 'One of them, Kristoff, becomes separated with his moose Sven.', 'When Queen Elsa flees Arendelle and Princess Anna gives chase, she quickly encounters Kristoff.']","First, note that the context refers to a fictional kingdom called Arendelle from Disney's Frozen. The story is a fairy tale and not a real-life setting. In the movie, Kristoff is a character who uses a moose, Sven, to help with his work as an ice cutter. When Princess Anna follows Queen Elsa, she meets Kristoff and his moose in the wilderness.

Given that this is a fictional context, we can infer that in the world of Frozen, moose are indeed used for work near the kingdom of Arendelle. The answer is 'True'.",True
Did Doctor Strange creators also make Batman?,"['Doctor Strange is a superhero created by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee.', 'Batman is a DC comics superhero.', 'Stan Lee worked for Marvel comics, the competitor of DC comics.', 'Steve Ditko worked for DC late in his career and worked on Blue Beetle, the Question, the Creeper, Shade the Changing Man, and Hawk and Dove.']","First, identify the creators of Doctor Strange: Steve Ditko and Stan Lee. Next, note that Batman is a DC comics superhero, and Stan Lee worked for Marvel comics, DC's competitor.

', 'Islamic culture avoids eating pork.', 'Ham is made from pork.']","First, consider Janet Jackson's religious practice: she follows Islam. In Islamic culture, the consumption of pork is prohibited. Ham is a food product derived from pork. Therefore, adhering to her religious beliefs, Janet Jackson would avoid a dish with ham. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can giant pandas sell out a Metallica show?,"['Metallica concerts are held in large arenas attended by tens of thousands of fans', 'The highest estimate for the giant panda population is around 3,000 animals']","First, consider the capacity of large arenas where Metallica concerts are held, which can hold tens of thousands of fans. Next, consider the highest estimate for the giant panda population, which is around 3,000 animals. Comparing these numbers, it is clear that the total number of giant pandas is significantly less than the number of fans that would typically attend a Metallica concert. Therefore, it is not possible for giant pandas to sell out a Metallica show based on their population size. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?,"['The United States has several zoos featuring hippopotamus.', 'In the UK, you can see hippopotamus at the Marwell Zoo.']","First, consider the locations mentioned in the context: zoos in the United States and the Marwell Zoo in the UK both have hippopotamus. These instances show that hippopotamus are not restricted to being seen only in Africa, as they are also kept in captivity in zoos outside Africa. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was Rumi's work serialized in a magazine?,"['Rumi was a poet who wrote poetry', 'Magazines serialize long-form prose like novels']","First, consider the nature of Rumi's work: he was a poet who wrote poetry, not long-form prose like novels. Second, understand what serialization in a magazine typically entails: it involves publishing installments of a longer work, such as a novel, over multiple issues of a magazine. Since Rumi's work consists of poetry and not novels, it would not have been appropriate for his work to be serialized in a magazine in the same way novels are. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was Charlemagne's father instrumental in outcome of the Battle of Tours?,"[""Charlemagne's father was Pepin the Short."", ""Pepin the Short's father was Charles Martel."", 'Charles Martel led an army against the Umayyads at the Battle of Tours.', 'Pepin the Short spent his early years being raised by monks.']","First, identify the key individuals mentioned: Charlemagne's father is Pepin the Short, and Pepin's father is Charles Martel. Charles Martel is known for leading an army against the Umayyads at the Battle of Tours. However, the context states that Pepin the Short spent his early years being raised by monks, which implies he was not directly involved in the battle.

Given that Charles Martel was the one who led the army at the Battle of Tours, and Pepin the Short was not actively involved due to his upbringing, it is not accurate to say that Charlemagne's father was instrumental in the outcome of the Battle of Tours.

Was Kane (wrestler) banned from WCW  headquarters city?,"['Kane (wrestler is a professional wrestler most known for his WWE tenure.', 'Kane wrestled one match in WCW as Bruiser Mastino.', 'WWE main rival WCW was headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Kane competed in an eight-man tag match at Wrestlemania XXVII in the Georgia Dome.', 'The Georgia Dome was a stadium in Atlanta Georgia.']","First, we need to establish if Kane (wrestler) was banned from WCW headquarters city. The context provided does not mention any ban on Kane by WCW or the city of Atlanta where WCW was headquartered. It only states that Kane wrestled one match in WCW and that he competed in an event in the Georgia Dome, which is located in Atlanta.

Since there is no information about a ban, we must assume that unless there is additional information not provided, Kane was not banned from the city. The answer is 'False'.",False

Would multiple average rulers be necessary to measure the length of a giant armadillo?,"['The average ruler is 12 inches or 30 centimeters in length.', 'The typical length of the giant armadillo is 75–100 cm (30–39 in), with the tail adding another 50 cm (20 in).']","First, consider the length of the average ruler, which is 30 centimeters or 12 inches. Next, look at the length of a giant armadillo, which is typically 75 to 100 centimeters (30 to 39 inches) without the tail. With the tail, the total length can be up to 120 centimeters (47 inches). Since the length of the armadillo, including its tail, is greater than the length of a single average ruler, multiple rulers would be needed to measure the full length. The answer is 'True'.",True
Did Eiffel Tower contribute to a war victory?,"['A radio transmitter located in the Eiffel Tower.', 'This transmitter jammed German radio communications.', 'This hindrance in German radio communications contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.']","First, note that there was a radio transmitter located in the Eiffel Tower during a time when France was involved in a war. Second, this transmitter was used to jam German radio communications, which would have disrupted their ability to coordinate and command their forces. Third, this disruption of German communications is stated to have contributed to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne. Given these points, it can be concluded that the Eiffel Tower's role in jamming radio communications did indeed contribute to a war victory. The answer is 'True'.",True
Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?,"['The War in Vietnam (1945-46) lasted around 6 months.', 'The gestation period for a llama is 11 months.']","First, determine the length of the War in Vietnam, which was around 6 months. Next, consider the gestation period for a llama, which is 11 months. Since a llama's gestation period is longer than the duration of the War in Vietnam, it would not be possible for a llama to give birth twice during that time frame. The answer is 'False'.",False
Has the Indian Ocean garbage patch not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery?,"['The Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010', 'The Indian Ocean garbage patch takes 6 years to complete a circulation ']","First, calculate the time passed since the discovery of the Indian Ocean garbage patch in 2010. We are currently in 2023, so 2023 - 2010 = 13 years have passed.
Next, consider the time it takes for the garbage patch to complete one circulation, which is given as 6 years.
To find out how many full rotations have occurred, divide the number of years passed by the time for one circulation: 13 years / 6 years/circulation = approximately 2.17 rotations.
Since a fraction of a rotation doesn't count as a full rotation, we can conclude that the Indian Ocean garbage patch has completed approximately 2 full rotations since its discovery, not two full rotations yet.

Could a chipmunk fit 100 chocolate chips in his mouth?,"['A chipmunk can fit up to two tbsp of food in his mouth.', 'There are about 20-25 chocolate chips in a tbsp.']","First, calculate the maximum number of chocolate chips a chipmunk can fit in its mouth by multiplying the maximum amount of food it can hold (two tbsp) by the average number of chocolate chips per tbsp (20-25). 
2 tbsp * 20-25 chocolate chips/tbsp = 40-50 chocolate chips

Now, compare this range to the claim of fitting 100 chocolate chips in its mouth.
40-50 chocolate chips is significantly less than 100 chocolate chips.

Would a pescatarian be unable to eat anchovy pizza?,"['Pescatarians do not eat red meat or chicken but do eat fish.', 'Pescatarians have no restrictions with eating cheese.']","First, understand the dietary restrictions of a pescatarian: they do not consume red meat or chicken but do eat fish. Next, consider the components of anchovy pizza: it typically consists of cheese and anchovies, with anchovies being a type of fish. Since pescatarians eat fish and there are no restrictions on eating cheese, they would be able to eat anchovy pizza.

Rhetoric is the art of persuasion, which involves using language effectively to sway audiences in specific situations. Second, recognize the role of lawyers, who must persuade juries that their side of a case is correct. Given that rhetoric is a key tool for persuasion and lawyers need to persuade others, it is reasonable to assume that individuals skilled in rhetoric like the Sophists would have had an advantage in the field of law.

Do some religions look forward to armageddon?,"['Evangelicals cite that we are living in the beginning of Armageddon and that the rapture will happen soon as a good thing.', ""Jehova's Witnesses believe that destroying the present world system and Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity""]","First, consider the beliefs of the religions mentioned in the context. Evangelicals and Jehovah's Witnesses are both mentioned. 
2. Evangelicals believe that the beginning of Armageddon signals the imminent rapture, which they view as a positive event leading to salvation.
3. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Armageddon is imminent and necessary to destroy the current world system and establish God's kingdom, which they see as a solution to humanity's problems.

Both of these religions anticipate Armageddon as a future event that is either a necessary step or a precursor to a better world. Therefore, the answer is 'True'.",True
Does coding rely on Boolean algebra characters?,"['Boolean algebra uses the characters of 1 and 0 to represent true and false.', 'Binary code is an essential part of computer coding.', 'Binary code consists of the characters 0 and 1 which represents strings of value.']","First, recognize that Boolean algebra uses 1 and 0 to represent true and false states.

Since binary code is an essential part of coding, it relies on the same 0 and 1 characters used in Boolean algebra. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would Amy Winehouse's death have been prevented with Narcan?,"['Narcan is a medication that save the life of someone overdosing on opiates.', 'Amy Winehouse died from alcohol poisoning.', 'Narcan cannot work on alcohol overdoses.']","First, understand the purpose of Narcan: it is a medication that can save the life of someone overdosing on opiates. Next, consider the cause of Amy Winehouse's death: alcohol poisoning. Narcan is specifically designed to counteract opiate overdoses and is not effective in treating alcohol poisoning. Therefore, Narcan would not have been effective in preventing Amy Winehouse's death since it does not address alcohol-related issues. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is Bern located east of Paris?,"['Paris is located in France.', 'Bern is located in Switzerland.', 'Switzerland borders France to the east.']","First, identify the locations of Paris and Bern: Paris is in France, and Bern is in Switzerland.

Are those incapable of reproduction incapable of parenthood?,"['Surrogates are women who will carry a baby to term for a family seeking to adopt.', 'Many children are put into the adoption and foster system every year and are always available to adopt, independent of the parents reproductive status.']","First, consider the definition of parenthood, which typically involves the responsibility and role of raising a child, not just biological reproduction. Surrogates, for example, can carry a child for a family seeking to adopt, demonstrating that parenthood can extend beyond biological reproduction. Additionally, many children in the adoption and foster system are available to be parented by individuals or couples regardless of their reproductive ability.

Given these points, it is possible for individuals who are incapable of reproduction to still fulfill the role and responsibilities of parenthood through adoption, fostering, or other means. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can Herpes simplex virus spread on Venus?,"['Herpes simplex virus is a disease that has the structure of a tiny protein cage.', 'Venus is the hottest planet and its temperature can reach 900°F.', 'Proteins lose their structure and break down at temperatures above 105.8°F.']","First, consider the structure of the Herpes simplex virus, which is a protein cage. Next, note that Venus has an extremely high temperature, reaching up to 900°F. Given that proteins begin to break down at temperatures above 105.8°F, it is highly unlikely that the virus could maintain its structure and function at Venus' temperatures. Therefore, the Herpes simplex virus would not be able to survive, let alone spread, on Venus. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would keelhauling be a fair punishment under the Eighth Amendment?,"['Keelhauling was a severe punishment whereby the condemned man was dragged beneath the ship’s keel on a rope.', 'Keelhauling is considered a form of torture.', 'Torture is considered cruel.', 'The Eighth Amendment forbids the use of ""cruel and unusual punishment"".']","First, identify the key points: Keelhauling is a form of torture, and torture is considered cruel. The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
Second, connect the context to the question: Since keelhauling is torture and the Eighth Amendment forbids cruel punishment, it would not be a fair punishment under that amendment.

Is Mixed martial arts totally original from Roman Colosseum games?,"['Mixed Martial arts in the UFC takes place in an enclosed structure called The Octagon.', 'The Roman Colosseum games were fought in enclosed arenas where combatants would fight until the last man was standing.', 'Mixed martial arts contests are stopped when one of the combatants is incapacitated.', 'The Roman Colosseum was performed in front of crowds that numbered in the tens of thousands.', 'Over 56,000 people attended UFC 193.']","First, consider the similarities between Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and Roman Colosseum games: both took place in enclosed arenas and featured combatants fighting until one was incapacitated. However, there are also differences, such as the stopping of MMA contests when a participant is incapacitated, which contrasts with the often-to-the-death nature of the Colosseum games. Additionally, both events were held in front of large crowds, but this is a general characteristic of public spectacles rather than a unique aspect of their similarity.

The key point to consider is the origin and development of the sports themselves. MMA is a modern combat sport that has evolved from various martial arts and fighting styles, while the Roman Colosseum games were a part of ancient Roman culture and entertainment, featuring a mix of different types of contests, including gladiatorial battles.

While there may be some thematic similarities in terms of combat and audience spectacle, the specific rules, training, and cultural context of MMA are distinct from those of the Roman Colosseum games. Therefore, Mixed Martial Arts cannot be considered totally original from Roman Colosseum games as it has developed from a different set of martial arts traditions rather than directly descending from the ancient spectacle.

Next, we consider the protection offered by an armadillo's bony plates (osteoderms), which can withstand some force but not a bullet. Given that a pistol's bullet is designed to penetrate, it is unlikely that an armadillo's armor would have been sufficient to protect Franz Ferdinand from the assassination attempt.

Did Sartre write a play about Hell?,"['In 1944, Sartre released No Exit.', 'No Exit is a play about three people mysteriously locked in a room together.', 'Late in the play, it is revealed the room is a version of Hell.']","First, we identify the key information from the context: Sartre released a play called ""No Exit"" in 1944, and this play is about three people trapped in a room. Later in the play, it is disclosed that the room is a representation of Hell. Given this information, it is accurate to say that Sartre wrote a play about Hell, as the setting of the play is explicitly revealed to be a version of Hell. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can rowing competitions take place indoors?,"['Rowing is a sport involving propelling boats.', 'Boats need a large body of water in order to move.', 'There are no indoor facilities big enough to host a pool with enough size for a boating competition.']","First, understand that rowing typically requires a large body of water for the boats to move. However, the context does not explicitly rule out the possibility of indoor rowing as an alternative or modified version of the sport. Indoor rowing machines are commonly used for training and there are competitions held for those machines, which simulate the rowing motion without the need for an actual boat on water.

Answer: False. While traditional rowing competitions cannot take place indoors due to the requirement for a large body of water, there are indoor rowing competitions that use specialized machines.",False

Next, look at the insurance valuation of The Mona Lisa: it had an equivalent value of $650 million as of 2018. Given Amazon's significant wealth and revenue, it is safe to assume that they could afford to purchase or financially support the insurance value of The Mona Lisa. The answer is 'True'.",True
Was Gandalf present at the death of Eomer?,"['Eomer died in a skirmish with orcs outside Rohan at the beginning of Two Towers.', 'Gandalf had been killed by the Balrog at the end of Fellowship of the Ring.', 'Gandalf returns with improved powers later on in Two Towers.']","First, establish the timeline of events: Eomer dies at the beginning of The Two Towers, and Gandalf dies and is later resurrected within the same book. Gandalf was indeed not present when Eomer died because he was still dead at that point, having been killed by the Balrog.

However, Gandalf returns to the story with increased powers later in The Two Towers. While he does come back, this happens after Eomer's death, so he still would not have been present for it.

Could a Gladiator's weapon crush a diamond?,"['Gladiators used a sword known as a Gladius.', 'The Gladius was a short sword made from various elements of steel.', 'Diamond is one the hardest known substances on earth.', 'Only diamond can be used to cut another diamond.']","First, consider the properties of a Gladiators' weapon, the Gladius. It was made from steel, which is a strong metal but not as hard as diamond. Next, consider the hardness of diamonds, which is the hardest known substance on Earth. Diamonds are so hard that they can only be cut by other diamonds. 

Given that the Gladius is not as hard as a diamond and diamonds are impervious to being cut or crushed by anything other than another diamond, it is unlikely that a Gladiators' weapon could crush a diamond. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution written without consideration for black Americans?,"['The writers of the Constitutional Amendments did not view black people as legitimate human beings.', 'The writers of the Constitutional Amendments believed that slavery benefited black slaves.', 'The Constitutional Amendments were written for people that the writers considered human.']","First, consider the context provided: the writers of the Constitutional Amendments did not view black people as legitimate human beings and believed that slavery benefited black slaves. This suggests that the writers did not have the same rights and considerations in mind for black Americans as they did for white Americans. The Second Amendment, like the rest of the Constitution, was written within this framework.

Do Sweet Potatoes prevent other plants from growing in their place?,"['When sweet potato plants decompose, they release a chemical that prevents germination in their soil.', 'Farmers will work to ensure that all parts of a sweet potato plant are out of the field before trying to grow in it again.']","First, consider the context provided: sweet potato plants release a chemical when they decompose that prevents germination in their soil. This suggests that there is a natural mechanism that could inhibit the growth of other plants in the same area.
Second, farmers take steps to remove all parts of the sweet potato plant from the field before planting again, which indicates that there may be a concern about the lasting effects of the plant on future crops.

Are Sable's a good choice of Mustelidae to weigh down a scale?,"['Mustelidae is the scientific designation for animals that share similarities including polecats, sables, and ferrets.', 'Polecats weigh between 2.2 and 3.3 pounds.', ""Sable's weigh around 2.4 pounds."", 'Ferrets can weigh up to 44 pounds.', ""Sable's have sharp teeth and a painful bite and are outlawed in many states.""]","First, consider the weight of Sables in comparison to other Mustelidae species. Sables weigh around 2.4 pounds, which is similar to the weight of polecats. Next, note that the context does not provide any information about using these animals to weigh down a scale, but rather gives information about their weights and characteristics. However, given their relatively small size, Sables would not be an efficient choice for weighing down a scale compared to larger animals like ferrets, which can weigh up to 44 pounds.

Additionally, the context mentions that Sables have sharp teeth and a painful bite, which could make them difficult or dangerous to handle for such a purpose. Furthermore, they are outlawed in many states, suggesting that there may be legal restrictions on keeping or using them.

Taking these factors into account, Sables would not be a practical or advisable choice for weighing down a scale. The answer is 'False'.",False

"While viewing ""Scary Movie"" is the viewer likely to experience an increase in adrenaline?","['Scary Movie is a film that is a comedy take on horror, intended to make viewers laugh but not afraid.', 'Adrenaline is produced when a human is frightened or excited.']","First, consider the genre of the film ""Scary Movie"": it is a comedy that parodies horror movies, meant to make viewers laugh rather than feel scared. Next, understand the context of adrenaline production: it occurs when a person is frightened or excited. Since ""Scary Movie"" is intended to be humorous and not genuinely frightening, it is less likely to induce fear in viewers.

However, some people might still experience a mild increase in adrenaline due to the excitement or anticipation associated with watching a horror parody, even if it's not intended to be scary. But the primary response is laughter, which might counteract the adrenaline rush one would get from a genuine horror film.

The answer is 'Somewhat True', as there might be a slight increase in adrenaline for some viewers due to excitement, but it's not the primary intended effect of the film, and the majority of viewers are more likely to experience laughter than fear.",False

', ""Neville's first appearances in the series show him to be very cowardly."", 'Neville is considered a hero by the end of the series.']","First, consider Neville Longbottom's character development throughout the Harry Potter series. In the early books, he is portrayed as timid and lacking courage. However, as the series progresses, Neville becomes more confident and demonstrates significant bravery, eventually being recognized as a hero.
Given that Neville's transformation from a cowardly child to a courageous adult is a key part of his character arc, it is clear that he displays more courage as an adult than he does as a child. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Atlantic Salmon be within David Duchovny's dietary guidelines?,"['David Duchovny is a pescatarian. ', 'Pescatarians do not eat chicken, pork, or beef, but will eat fish.']","First, understand that David Duchovny follows a pescatarian diet, which means he does not consume chicken, pork, or beef, but does include fish in his meals. Atlantic Salmon is a type of fish. Since pescatarians eat fish, it would be within David Duchovny's dietary guidelines. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can the largest crustacean stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress?,"['The largest crustacean is the Japanese spider crab ', 'The largest Japanese spider crabs have a leg span of just over 12 feet ', 'The longer edge of a king-sized mattress is six feet, eight inches']","First, we need to compare the leg span of the largest Japanese spider crab with the length of the longer edge of a king-sized mattress. The leg span of the largest Japanese spider crab is just over 12 feet, while the longer edge of a king-sized mattress is six feet, eight inches. Since 12 feet is greater than 6 feet, 8 inches, the crab's leg span is longer than the length of the mattress edge.

However, a crustacean's body also needs space, not just its legs. The Japanese spider crab has a large body in addition to its long legs. While the legs might stretch out on the mattress, the body would likely not fit comfortably or completely on a king-sized mattress.

Can you use the T-Mobile tuesdays app if you aren't a T-Mobile customer?,"['T-Mobile tuesdays is a rewards app for T-Mobile subscribers.', 'T-Mobile Tuesdays verifies users by making sure they have a T-Mobile phone number.']","First, understand the purpose of the T-Mobile Tuesdays app: it is a rewards app designed specifically for T-Mobile subscribers. Second, consider how the app verifies users: it checks if the user has a T-Mobile phone number. Given that the app is exclusive to T-Mobile customers and verifies users based on their T-Mobile phone number, it is not possible for non-T-Mobile customers to use the app. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?,"['Brooke Shields graduated from Princeton University.', 'Princeton is ranked as the number 1 national college by US news.', 'University of Pennsylvania is ranked as number 6 national college by US news.', 'Princeton only admits around 6 percent of applicants as of 2018.', 'University of Pennsylvania accepts around 9% of applicants as of 2018.']","First, we know that Brooke Shields successfully graduated from Princeton University, which is a highly prestigious institution. This implies that she has the academic capabilities to succeed in a rigorous academic environment. 

Next, we consider the rankings of the universities: Princeton is ranked higher than the University of Pennsylvania, but both are highly ranked national colleges. A higher ranking does not necessarily mean that the education is significantly more challenging for all students; it could reflect various factors like research output or selectivity.

Lastly, we look at the acceptance rates: Princeton has a lower acceptance rate (6%) compared to the University of Pennsylvania (9%). A lower acceptance rate generally indicates a more competitive pool of applicants, but it does not guarantee that the academic experience is more difficult for those who are admitted.

Given that Brooke Shields was able to succeed at Princeton, which is more selective than the University of Pennsylvania, and assuming her academic performance was strong enough to gain admission to both institutions, it is likely that she could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania.

As such, it is frequently invoked in court cases involving the sentencing and treatment of individuals convicted of crimes. The Fifth Amendment, while also important in criminal cases, is a different amendment addressing the rights of individuals during legal proceedings. The Fourteenth Amendment, with its focus on equal protection, is another separate legal basis for court cases. Therefore, the Eighth Amendment is indeed popular in court, particularly within the context of criminal law and human rights. The answer is 'True'.",False
Would a teacher still have their job if they called a black student an ape?,"[""'Ape' and 'monkey' are words that have been used in a derogatory manner against black people."", 'Teachers are held to a level of professionalism and cannot act in an abusive way towards children.']","First, understand the context that the words 'ape' and 'monkey' have been used historically as racist slurs against black people. Second, recognize that teachers are expected to maintain a high level of professionalism and are not allowed to engage in abusive behavior towards students. Given these points, if a teacher were to call a black student an ape, it would be considered严重 abuse and highly likely result in termination of their job due to violation of professional conduct and the harmful nature of the comment.

Next, we note that the golden toad is an amphibian. However, the context also mentions that the golden toad is rare and has not been seen since 1989, implying that it is likely extinct or at least extremely uncommon. Since storks have a diverse diet and the golden toad is not a primary or essential part of it, storks would not need golden toads to survive.

Does frost mean that it will be a snowy day?,"['Frost forms regularly in areas that experience freezing temperatures and morning dew.', ""Frost isn't deposited from the sky like snow, it forms on the ground.""]","Frost occurs when the temperature falls below freezing, causing water vapor to condense on surfaces and form ice crystals. While frost and snow are both ice-related weather phenomena, they form under different conditions. Frost forms on the ground due to cold temperatures and the presence of moisture, whereas snow forms in the clouds when supercooled water droplets freeze mid-air. Snowfall requires specific atmospheric conditions, including lower temperatures at higher elevations, moisture, and lifting mechanisms to create clouds. Therefore, frost does not necessarily mean it will be a snowy day; it simply indicates that the temperature has dropped below freezing. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can a quarter fit inside of a human kidney?,"['Kidney stones are hard mineral deposits that can form in the kidneys.', 'The largest kidney stone ever recorded was 13 cm wide.', 'The diameter of a quarter is 2.4 cm.']","First, consider the size of a quarter compared to the size of a human kidney. A quarter has a diameter of 2.4 cm. Kidney stones, which can be an indication of the size of the inside space within a kidney, can be quite large. The largest kidney stone ever recorded was 13 cm wide, which is significantly larger than a quarter.

However, it's important to note that a kidney is not a hollow space; it is a complex organ with structures inside that would not allow for a quarter to fit inside even if the stone itself were that large. Kidneys have a complex network of tubules and other structures that would prevent a quarter from being inserted.

Could a hundred thousand lolcats fit on a first generation iPhone?,"['Lolcat memes are often in jpeg form', 'The average size of a jpeg is 10 to 30 kb', 'One gigabyte is 1000000 kb', 'The first iPhone had 4GB to 16GB of storage ']","First, calculate the approximate maximum number of jpeg files that can fit in 16GB of storage, considering the average size of a jpeg is between 10 and 30 kb:
- 16GB = 16,000,000 kb (converting gigabytes to kilobytes)
- At 10 kb per file, 16,000,000 / 10 = 1,600,000 files
- At 30 kb per file, 16,000,000 / 30 = 533,333 files

Now, consider the lower and upper bounds for the number of lolcats that could fit:
- At most, with 10 kb jpegs, 1,600,000 lolcats could fit.
- At least, with 30 kb jpegs, 533,333 lolcats could fit.

Given that 100,000 is less than both 533,333 and 1,600,000, it is possible for a hundred thousand lolcats to fit on a first generation iPhone, assuming the average size of the lolcat jpeg files is within the given range.

Are all characters in Legend of Robin Hood fictional?,"['The Legend of Robin Hood tells of an archer that stole from the rich and gave to the poor.', ""Robin Hood's main antagonist is the Sheriff of Nottingham."", 'The Sheriff of Nottingham is an agent for Prince John who has usurped the throne from his brother Richard.', 'Richard I was King of England from 1189-1199.', 'Prince John became John, King of England and reigned from 1199-1216.']","First, we identify the real historical figures mentioned in the context: Richard I (1189-1199) and John, King of England (1199-1216). The context states that Prince John usurped the throne from his brother Richard. 

Next, we look at the fictional elements: Robin Hood, an archer who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, and the Sheriff of Nottingham, who serves as his main antagonist.

Since Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham are not mentioned in historical records and are central figures in the legend, they are fictional characters.

Can Vice President of the United States kill with impunity?,"[' Vice President Aaron Burr fatally wounded Alexander Hamilton in a duel on July 11, 1804.', 'Aaron Burr continued his term as Vice President of the United States after killing Alexander Hamilton.', 'US stand-your-ground laws allow a person to defend themselves even to the point of applying lethal force.']","First, note that the context provides a historical example of a Vice President, Aaron Burr, who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel and continued his term as Vice President. However, dueling was a socially accepted practice at the time, which is very different from modern circumstances.

Second, consider that stand-your-ground laws are not applicable to intentional killings in self-defense; they typically refer to situations where a person reasonably believes they are in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death. The killing of Hamilton in a duel does not fit the typical parameters of a stand-your-ground defense.

In modern times, the Vice President, like any other citizen, would be subject to the law if they were to kill someone. They would not be immune from prosecution simply because of their position.

Is radioactive waste a plot device for many shows?,"['Radioactive isotopes in an ooze-like waste cause turtles to become the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.', 'In the Fox animated hit, Family Guy, radioactive waste is used to turn give the main characters superpowers. ', ""The superhero 'Daredevil' encounters radioactive waste that blinds him as a child and gives him super powers.""]","First, we look at the context provided, which includes three examples from popular media:
1. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are created through exposure to radioactive isotopes in waste.
2. In Family Guy, characters gain superpowers from radioactive waste.
3. In the story of Daredevil, the protagonist is blinded by radioactive waste and gains heightened senses.

These examples demonstrate that radioactive waste is indeed used as a plot device in various shows and stories to create unique situations or give characters special abilities. Therefore, the answer is 'True'.",True
Are raw carrots better for maximizing vitamin A intake?,"[' 3% of the β-carotene in raw carrots is released during digestion, which can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil', 'Retinal is a form of Vitamin A', 'Human bodies break down β-carotene into retinal']","First, consider the absorption rate of vitamin A from raw carrots, which is only 3% due to the presence of cell walls that limit the release of β-carotene. Cooking and processing methods like pulping, cooking, and adding cooking oil can increase the release of β-carotene to 39%. Beta-carotene is then converted into retinal, a form of vitamin A, in the human body. 

Since cooking carrots enhances the bioavailability of vitamin A by increasing the release of β-carotene, it would be more beneficial for maximizing vitamin A intake. Therefore, eating cooked carrots with oil would be a better choice than eating them raw. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does Metallica use Soulseek?,"['Soulseek is a computer program used to illegally share music files', 'Metallica has been outspoken in their opposition of digital piracy']","First, consider the purpose of Soulseek: it is a program used for illegally sharing music files.

US laws dictate voting requirements, which include being a citizen of the United States. The President of Mexico in 2020, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is a Mexican citizen and therefore not a US citizen. As a result, he would not be eligible to vote in US elections, including New Mexico primaries.

Would a birdwatcher pursue their hobby at a Philadelphia Eagles game?,"['Birdwatching is a recreational activity in which people observe and/or listen to the sounds of birds.', 'Despite their name, the Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American Football team comprised of humans, not birds.']","First, understand the purpose of birdwatching, which is to observe and listen to birds. Second, recognize that the Philadelphia Eagles are a human football team and not a group of birds. Therefore, a birdwatcher would not pursue their hobby at a Philadelphia Eagles game because the event does not provide an opportunity to observe or listen to birds. The answer is 'False'.",False
Are monks forbidden from engaging in warfare?,"['Monks are members of religious orders that usually take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.', 'The Knights Templar were a religious order that fought during the Crusades and captured Jerusalem in 1099.', 'Buddhist Shaolin monks developed very powerful martial arts skills, have defended temples during conquests.']","First, consider the general role of monks in religious orders, which typically involves vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. These vows often imply a focus on spiritual pursuits rather than worldly conflicts. However, historical examples like the Knights Templar and Buddhist Shaolin monks show that some religious orders or individual monks have engaged in warfare.

The context does not provide a universal rule that all monks must abstain from warfare. Instead, it demonstrates variation in the practices of different orders and individual interpretations of monastic vows. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that all monks are forbidden from engaging in warfare.

The answer is 'False'.",False

Second, understand the effect of long cooking times on shrimp: they become tough and rubbery. Given that the desired texture is not achieved with long cooking times and that overcooked shrimp lose their appeal, it can be concluded that shrimp do not taste best when cooked for a long time. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can a minotaur hypothetically injure a tibia playing football?,"['A minotaur is a mythological creature with the head of a bull and the body of a human.', 'The tibia is the bone between the knee and the ankle in humans.', 'Tibia injuries are common injuries in contact sports such as football.']","First, consider the context: the tibia is a bone in the human leg that is commonly injured in contact sports like football. While a minotaur is a mythological creature, for the purpose of this question, we can assume it has a similar anatomy to a human in terms of bones.
Second, football is a contact sport where tibia injuries can occur due to collisions and impacts.
Third, since a minotaur has a human-like lower body, it would have a tibia that could potentially be injured in the same way as a human's during football.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Did François Mitterrand serve under Napoleon Bonapart in the French army?,"['François Mitterrand was born in 1916.', 'Napoleon Bonapart died in 1821.']","First, consider the birth years of both individuals: François Mitterrand was born in 1916, while Napoleon Bonaparte died in 1821.

Next, consider Christopher Hitchens' beliefs: he was an anti-theist who rejected all religions. Given his strong opposition to religion, it is highly unlikely that he would engage in a religious practice like tonsure. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is menthol associated with Christmas?,"['Menthol is the chemical in mint products that give mint its characteristic cool and tangy taste.', 'Peppermint is a popular candy flavor during Christmas season.']","First, consider the properties of menthol, which is the chemical responsible for the cool and tangy taste in mint products. Next, note that peppermint, a type of mint, is a common flavor in candies and other confections consumed during the Christmas season. The association between peppermint and Christmas suggests that the flavor, and by extension, menthol, may be indirectly linked to the holiday due to its prevalence in seasonal treats.

Since amoebas do not have multiple cells, the development of cancer as it is typically understood in multicellular organisms cannot occur in a single-celled organism like an amoeba. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does Magnus Carlsen enjoy KFC?,"['Magnus Carlsen is a chess grandmaster from Norway', 'There are no KFC locations in Norway']","First, consider the information provided: Magnus Carlsen is a chess grandmaster from Norway, and there are no KFC locations in Norway. While this context does not directly state whether Magnus Carlsen enjoys KFC or not, it implies that he would not have the opportunity to enjoy it regularly since it is not available in his home country. However, it is still possible that he might like it based on personal preference or if he has tried it outside of Norway.

The answer is 'Unknown' as there is not enough information to confirm whether he enjoys KFC or not.",False
Is it expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla?,"['In 2009, Charla Nash was attacked and nearly killed by a chimpanzee. ', 'While a different species, Gorillas and Chimpanzees have similar physical appearances and are both primates.']","First, consider the event in Charla Nash's life: in 2009, she was attacked and nearly killed by a chimpanzee. This traumatic experience would likely cause fear or anxiety related to similar animals. Second, note the context that gorillas and chimpanzees have similar physical appearances and are both primates. Given the similarity between gorillas and the chimpanzee that attacked her, it is reasonable to expect that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla.

Is Oculudentavis more dangerous than Allosaurus?,"['Oculudentavis was a dinosaur that resembled a tiny bird with a half an inch skull.', 'The Allosaurus was a carnivorous dinosaur with teeth described as saws.']","First, consider the characteristics of Oculudentavis: it was a small dinosaur with a tiny skull, resembling a bird. This suggests it was likely not very dangerous compared to larger carnivorous dinosaurs. Now, consider the Allosaurus: it was a large carnivorous dinosaur with锯齿状的牙齿, which indicates it was a formidable predator. 

Given the size and hunting capabilities of these two dinosaurs, it is reasonable to conclude that the Allosaurus was more dangerous than Oculudentavis. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a packed Wembley stadium be likely to have a descendant of the Mongols inside?,"['Wembley stadium has a capacity of 90,000 people.', 'The Mongols were an ethnic group that dominated the 13th and 14th centuries.', 'Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol Empire.', 'Geneticists have determined that 1 in every 200 men are descended from Genghis Khan.']","First, consider the number of people a packed Wembley stadium can hold: 90,000. Given that geneticists have found that approximately 1 in 200 men carry DNA traceable to Genghis Khan, we can calculate the expected number of Genghis Khan's descendants in a crowd of 90,000 by dividing the total number of people by 200.

90,000 / 200 = 450

This means we would expect to find around 450 descendants of Genghis Khan in a packed Wembley stadium. Given the large number, it is highly likely that there would be at least one descendant of the Mongols present. The answer is 'True'.",True

Would a rabbi worship martyrs Ranavalona I killed?,"['Rabbis are teachers of Judaism.', 'Ranavalona I, ruler of Madagascar, killed many Christians that were later determined by the church to be martyrs.', 'Judaism does not have a group of saints and martyrs that are prayed to like Christianity..']","First, consider the role of a rabbi in Judaism: they are teachers of the religion and do not typically engage in worship of individuals outside the core religious figures. Next, understand the context of Ranavalona I's actions: she was a ruler who persecuted Christians, some of whom were later recognized by the Christian church as martyrs. Judaism, however, does not have a practice of venerating or worshiping martyrs or saints.

Given that rabbis are figures in Judaism and Judaism does not involve worshiping martyrs or saints, it is not consistent with the religious practices of Judaism for a rabbi to worship the martyrs killed by Ranavalona I, who were Christian martyrs recognized by the Christian church.

Are there tearjerkers about United Airlines flights?,"['Tearjerkers typically refer to a genre of movie. ', 'United Airlines flight 93 was involved in a terrorist attack in 2001.', 'Several flights memorialize the passengers of Flight 93,.']","First, understand that tearjerkers usually refer to movies that evoke strong emotional responses, particularly sadness. Next, consider the context provided: United Airlines Flight 93 was a tragic event linked to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which can be emotionally impactful for many people. While there might not be movies specifically classified as tearjerkers focusing on United Airlines flights, the memory of Flight 93 and other similar events could be emotionally moving for viewers, even if it's not a genre label applied to a film.

The answer is 'True', considering that the events surrounding United Airlines Flight 93 can be emotionally charged and might elicit tears or strong emotions in those who remember or learn about it, even if there isn't a movie explicitly labeled as a tearjerker about the flight.",True

Would James Cotton's instrument be too strident for a smooth jazz band?,"['Smooth jazz is an offshoot of jazz music that relies on a more melodic form.', 'Smooth jazz employs the following instruments: saxophone. guitar. piano. trumpet. synthesizer. electric bass. and drums.', 'James Cotton was a famous blues harmonica player.']","First, consider the nature of smooth jazz, which is an offshoot of jazz that focuses on melodic content. Smooth jazz typically features instruments like saxophones, guitars, pianos, trumpets, synthesizers, electric bass, and drums. These instruments contribute to a mellow and soothing sound.

Now, consider James Cotton's instrument: the blues harmonica. The harmonica is known for its ability to produce a range of tones, including a more aggressive and expressive sound often associated with blues music, which can be contrasted with the smooth and mellow tone of smooth jazz.

Given that the harmonica, especially when played in a blues style like James Cotton was known for, might not fit the melodic and soothing atmosphere of smooth jazz, it is likely that his instrument would be considered too strident for a smooth jazz band.

Ginger is not mentioned among these ingredients. Second, consider that ginger has a distinct spicy flavor, while Starbucks Passion tea is described as a sweet drink, which implies it is more likely to contain sweet or complementary flavors rather than spicy ones like ginger. Based on this information, ginger is not included in Starbucks Passion tea. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can eating grapefruit kill besides allergies or choking?,"['Grapefruit is a citrus fruit consumed mostly during the summer months.', 'Chemicals in grapefruit can interact with medications such as statins.', 'Grapefruit can lead to too much absorption of statin medicine.', 'Too much statins can cause severe muscle pain, liver damage, kidney failure and death.

Second, consider the context that untreated jealousy often leads to the dissolution of relationships. If someone is prone to jealousy, it is likely that this emotion could create challenges and potential breakups in a polyamorous setup where multiple relationships are involved. Effective communication, trust, and jealousy management are crucial in polyamorous relationships. Given the individual's predisposition to jealousy, it might be difficult for them to navigate the complexities of such an arrangement without addressing their jealousy issues first.

Did Disney get most of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book profits?,"[""Rudyard Kipling's 1894 book The Jungle Book has was adapted into several Disney films."", 'The 2016 film The Jungle Book grossed over 966 million dollars.', ""Disney's 1967 film version of The Jungle Book grossed over 378 million dollars."", ""The Jungle Book was not a worldwide phenomenon in Kipling's time.""]","First, consider the context that The Jungle Book was not a worldwide phenomenon during Kipling's time. This implies that Kipling's original profits from the book would have been significantly lower than what Disney has earned from its adaptations.
Next, look at the box office earnings for the two Disney films mentioned: the 1967 version grossed over 378 million dollars, while the 2016 version grossed over 966 million dollars. These figures represent a substantial portion of the revenue generated by The Jungle Book adaptations.
However, it's important to note that profit margins for Disney would also include production costs, marketing expenses, and distribution fees, which would reduce the percentage of the gross revenue that actually becomes profit.

Given that Disney has produced and distributed multiple successful adaptations of The Jungle Book, it is reasonable to conclude that Disney has earned a significant majority of the profits related to The Jungle Book, especially considering the much larger box office success of the 2016 film compared to Kipling's original book sales.

Are tumors in the lymph nodes ignorable?,"['Lymphoma is a serious type of cancer that can begin with tumors in the lymph nodes.', 'Lymphoma can kill when left untreated.']","First, understand that lymph nodes are part of the body's immune system and help filter out harmful substances. Tumors in the lymph nodes can be a sign of lymphoma, a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. 
Second, consider the context that lymphoma, if left untreated, can be fatal. This implies that tumors in the lymph nodes, which could be an early indication of lymphoma, should not be ignored as they could be a sign of a serious medical condition.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Alexander Hamilton have known about koalas?,"['Alexander Hamilton died in 1804.', 'The first published depiction of a koala was in 1810.']","First, consider the timeline: Alexander Hamilton died in 1804, while the first published depiction of a koala was in 1810. This means that Hamilton would have been alive before the koala was publicly known. However, since the discovery and documentation of new species often took time to circulate, especially from remote locations like Australia, it's unlikely that Alexander Hamilton, who was a political figure in the United States, would have had direct knowledge of the koala at the time of his death.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Does the Dalai Lama believe in the divine barzakh?,"['The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism', 'The divine barzakh is a concept from Islam']","The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, which is a different religion than Islam. The divine barzakh is a concept from Islam. Since the Dalai Lama's beliefs are rooted in Buddhism and not Islam, he would not have a belief in the divine barzakh as it is not part of his religious tradition. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Spiderman fight against Falcon in the MCU?,"['In Captain America: Civil War, Iron Man and Captain America became enemies following a disagreement.', 'Iron Man summoned Spiderman to fight with his team of still-loyal Avengers.', ""Falcon was one of Captain America's best friends and supported the Captain in the conflict."", 'Therefore, Spiderman and Falcon were on opposite teams during the inter-Avenger battle in the movie.']","First, recall that in Captain America: Civil War, Iron Man and Captain America's disagreement led to a split among the Avengers. Iron Man assembled a team that included Spiderman, while Captain America had allies like Falcon. During the conflict, there was a major battle between the two factions.
Given that Spiderman was on Iron Man's team and Falcon was on Captain America's team, they were directly opposed to each other in the film's central fight scene. Therefore, Spiderman did fight against Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) during Captain America: Civil War.
The answer is 'True'.",True
Is Pig Latin related to real Latin?,"['Pig Latin is based on English.', 'It is formed by moving consonants and syllables.', 'Real Latin is a separate language distinct from English.']","First, consider the origins of Pig Latin: it is based on the English language and involves manipulating consonants and syllables. Next, consider the nature of real Latin, which is a distinct, separate language from English with its own grammar, vocabulary, and history. Since Pig Latin is derived from English and not directly from Latin, it is not related to real Latin in the sense of being a descendant or variation of the Latin language. The answer is 'False'.",False
Will the torso be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in body?,"['The three smallest bone in the body are malleus, incus, and stapes.', 'Malleus, incus, and stapes are located in the ear.', 'The femur is the largest bone in the body.', 'The femur is located in the leg.', 'The torso is located in the center of the body.']","First, identify which bones are being referred to: the largest bone is the femur, located in the leg, and the smallest bones are the malleus, incus, and stapes, located in the ear. Next, consider the location of the torso: it is in the center of the body. The femur is not part of the torso, and blows to the femur would not directly affect the torso. The smallest bones are in the ear, which is also not part of the torso. Therefore, blows to the largest and smallest bones in the body would not directly affect the torso.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Would Kelly Clarkson's voice shake glass?,"['Glass vibrates at its resonant frequency which is around a middle C note.', 'Kelly Clarkson has an impressive three octave vocal range.', ""Kelly Clarkson's Never Enough is in the key of A-flat."", 'A-flat is above middle C in terms of notes.']","First, we know that glass vibrates at its resonant frequency, which is around a middle C note. Kelly Clarkson has an impressive three octave vocal range, which means she can sing from a low note to a high note covering three octaves. Her song ""Never Enough"" is in the key of A-flat. A-flat is a note above middle C in terms of notes, meaning it has a higher frequency.

Given that Kelly Clarkson can sing notes above middle C, including those in the A-flat key, it is theoretically possible for her to produce a frequency high enough to match or exceed the resonant frequency of certain types of glass, causing it to vibrate or even shatter if the volume and pitch are properly aligned.

However, this would depend on various factors such as the specific resonant frequency of the glass, the volume at which Kelly sings, and the accuracy of her pitch. In practice, it's unlikely that she would intentionally or unintentionally produce a frequency powerful enough to shake glass during a regular performance, as doing so could damage the glass and potentially harm listeners.

The answer is 'True' in a theoretical sense but 'False' in a practical context, as it's not something that would typically happen during a performance.",True
Did the Berlin Wall prevent any athletes from competing in the 1936 Summer Olympics?,"['The 1936 Olympics were held in 1936.', 'The Berlin Wall was not constructed until 1961.']","The Berlin Wall was not constructed until 1961, long after the 1936 Summer Olympics took place. Therefore, the Berlin Wall could not have prevented athletes from competing in the 1936 games. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is Shiva's divine dance an ancient physical fitness pose?,"[""In yoga as exercise, the pose called Natarajasara represents Shiva's divine dance"", 'This pose is new, originating in the early 20th century', 'Exercise is an activity that maintains physical fitness']","First, we understand that the pose called Natarajasana in yoga is inspired by Shiva's divine dance. However, the context states that this pose originated in the early 20th century, which is relatively recent compared to the ancient roots of both yoga and the传说 of Shiva. While the pose may be a physical fitness exercise now, it is not an ancient physical fitness pose since it was created in the modern era.

Is Route 66 generally unknown to Americans?,"['Route 66 was immortalized in the hit ""Route 66"" by Bobby Troupe.', '""Route 66"" as a song has reached the Billboard Top Charts multiple times and is still played often.']","First, consider the context that Route 66 was immortalized in a hit song called ""Route 66"" by Bobby Troupe. This song has reached the Billboard Top Charts multiple times and is still played often. Given the popularity and cultural significance of the song, it is likely that Route 66 is well-known to many Americans due to its association with the hit tune. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Woodrow Wilson support Plessy v. Ferguson decision?,"['Plessy v Ferguson was a landmark case that stated segregation did not violate the constitution.', 'President Woodrow Wilson escalated the discriminatory hiring policies and segregation of government offices.', 'By the end of 1913, under President Wilson, many departments, including the navy, had segregated work spaces, restrooms, and cafeterias.']","First, understand the context of the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which stated that segregation did not violate the Constitution. Next, consider Woodrow Wilson's actions as president, which included escalating discriminatory hiring policies and promoting segregation within government offices. By the end of 1913, under his administration, various departments had implemented segregation practices.

Given that Wilson's actions align with and support the principles of segregation upheld by the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, it is reasonable to conclude that he would support the decision. The answer is 'True'.",True
Are the Vietnamese people a great untapped resource for NBA players?,"['Vietnam was ranked as one of the countries with the shortest people on average, in 2019.', 'The average height of a Vietnamese man is 5 feet 4.74 inches.', 'The average height of an NBA player in 2018 was 6 foot 7 inches tall.']","First, consider the average heights provided: Vietnamese men have an average height of 5 feet 4.74 inches, while NBA players have an average height of 6 feet 7 inches. The significant height difference between the general Vietnamese population and NBA players would make it statistically less likely for越南to have a large pool of untapped basketball talent suitable for the NBA. Height is often a crucial factor in basketball, particularly at the professional level.

Are there multiple Star Wars TV shows produced by Disney?,"['Star Wars Rebels and Star Wars Resistance were released after Disney bought ownership of Star Wars.', 'Disney also produced the first live-action TV show set in the Star Wars galaxy, The Mandalorian.', 'Disney produced one additional revival season of Star Wars Clone Wars which was originally produced before Disney owned Star Wars.']","First, note that the context mentions four TV shows produced by Disney that are set in the Star Wars galaxy: Star Wars Rebels, Star Wars Resistance, The Mandalorian, and a revival season of Star Wars Clone Wars. Since there are multiple TV shows listed, the answer is 'True'. The answer is 'True'.",True
"Will every resident of Los Angeles County, California go to Jehovah Witnesses's heaven?","['Jehovah Witnesses believe that exactly 144,000 people will be saved and go to heaven.', 'There are over 10 million residents of Los Angeles County, California as of 2019.']","First, consider the belief of Jehovah Witnesses regarding heaven: they believe that only 144,000 people will be saved and go to heaven. Next, consider the population of Los Angeles County, California, which is over 10 million people as of 2019. Since the number of people Jehovah Witnesses believe will go to heaven is significantly less than the population of Los Angeles County, it is impossible for every resident of the county to go to Jehovah Witnesses' heaven according to their belief.

Was the AK-47 used in the Seven Years' War?,"[""The Seven Years' War took place between 1756 and 1763."", 'The AK-47 was developed in the 1940s.']","First, identify the time periods of the events in question: the Seven Years' War took place between 1756 and 1763, while the AK-47 was developed in the 1940s. Since the AK-47 was developed several decades after the conclusion of the Seven Years' War, it could not have been used during that conflict. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do Australians ride Kangaroos to work?,"['Kangaroos can become aggressive if they feel a human is too close or is threatening them.', 'There are no parking areas or stalls for Kangaroos in Australia. ', ""It would be considered animal abuse to ride on a kangaroo and leave it at one's job.""]","First, consider the behavior of kangaroos: they can become aggressive if they feel threatened or too close to humans. Second, note that there are no provisions for parking or stabling kangaroos in Australia, which would be necessary if people were riding them as a means of transportation. Lastly, riding a kangaroo and leaving it at one's job would likely be considered animal abuse, as it goes against the welfare and natural habits of the animal. Given these points, it is highly unlikely that Australians ride kangaroos to work. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did origin dynasty of Go precede Jia Sidao?,"['Go is a strategy game that originated in the Zhou dynasty.', 'The Zhou dynasty lasted from 1046 BC – 256 BC.', 'Jia Sidao was a chancellor during the late Song dynasty.', 'The Song dynasty started in 960 AD and lasted until 1279 AD.']","First, identify the time periods of the Zhou and Song dynasties. The Zhou dynasty lasted from 1046 BC to 256 BC, while the Song dynasty started in 960 AD and lasted until 1279 AD. Since the Zhou dynasty came before the Song dynasty, and Go originated in the Zhou dynasty, it predates the time when Jia Sidao lived. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would Emma Roberts's Nancy Drew be considered a private investigator?,"['Emma Roberts starred as Nancy Drew in the 2007 film titled Nancy Drew.', 'A private investigator is hired by an individual to solve a crime.', 'Nancy Drew from the 2007 film was described as an amateur sleuth.', 'Nancy Drew in the 2007 film was interested in a case and decided to pursue it on her own, without being paid for it.']","First, consider the definition of a private investigator: someone hired by an individual to solve a crime. Next, look at the context provided for Nancy Drew in the 2007 film: she is described as an amateur sleuth and pursued a case out of personal interest without being paid for it. Since Nancy Drew from the film was not hired for her investigation and acted independently, she does not fit the definition of a private investigator. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a Bulgarian priest eat a four-course meal on Christmas Eve?,"['A four-course meal consists of a soup, an appetizer, an entrée, and dessert.', 'The Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal has an odd number of dishes and an odd number of people sitting around the table.']","First, consider the traditional Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal: it consists of an odd number of dishes and an odd number of people sitting around the table. A four-course meal, as described, consists of exactly four dishes, which is an even number. Therefore, a traditional Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal would not typically include a four-course meal with a soup, appetizer, entrée, and dessert.

However, it's important to note that personal preferences and modern adaptations may allow for variations in holiday traditions. A Bulgarian priest, like any individual, could choose to have a four-course meal on Christmas Eve despite the traditional customs.

Given the context provided, the answer would lean towards 'False' for a strict adherence to traditional practices. But if considering individual choices and modern variations, the answer could be 'True' for a priest who chooses to have a four-course meal. Without more specific information on the priest's personal practices or whether they follow traditions strictly, the most accurate answer based on the context given is:

The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Helen Keller ever read a novel by J. K. Rowling?,"['Helen Keller died in 1968.', ""J. K. Rowling's first novel was published in 1997.""]","First, consider the years of birth and death of Helen Keller and the publication year of J.K. Rowling's first novel. Helen Keller died in 1968, while J.K. Rowling's first novel, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" was published in 1997. Since Helen Keller died 29 years before J.K. Rowling's novel was published, she could not have read any of Rowling's novels. The answer is 'False'.",False
Are a dozen pickles good for easing hypertension?,"['Hypertension is high blood pressure that can come from a number of factors including excess salt.', 'Pickles are food that are high in sodium, or salt.']","First, consider the information about hypertension: it is high blood pressure that can be exacerbated by excess salt intake. Next, note that pickles are high in sodium (salt). Given that increased sodium intake can contribute to high blood pressure, consuming a dozen pickles, which would provide a significant amount of sodium, would not be advisable for someone trying to ease hypertension. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Garfield like canid food?,"['Garfield is a fictional comic strip character that is a cat. ', 'Garfield loves to eat spaghetti.', 'Canid refers to the species that dogs belong to.', 'Dogs like to eat meat and dog food.']","First, Garfield is a cat, and cats typically have different dietary preferences than dogs. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they primarily need meat in their diet. 
Second, Garfield's favorite food is mentioned as spaghetti, which is not a typical cat food but indicates his preference for human food.
Third, canid food is designed for dogs and typically contains meat, which is suitable for a dog's diet but might not be appealing to a cat.

Given Garfield's status as a cat with a preference for non-carnivorous food like spaghetti, it is unlikely that he would enjoy canid food meant for dogs. The answer is 'False'.",False

Would Iceland lose to Amazon in a bidding war?,"['Iceland had a nominal GDP of $27 billion as of a 2018 estimate.', 'Amazon recorded revenues of $232.887 billion in the 2018 fiscal year.']","First, consider the GDP of Iceland, which is $27 billion, and the revenues of Amazon, which were $232.887 billion in the 2018 fiscal year. Amazon's revenues are significantly higher than Iceland's nominal GDP. In a bidding war, the entity with more financial resources typically has a greater ability to outbid others. Given Amazon's much larger revenue, it would have far more financial capacity to compete in a bidding war compared to Iceland. The answer is 'True'.",True
Could boolean algebra be described as binary?,"['Binary options tend to have 2 instead of 10 as a base. ', 'Binary directly describes something composed of 2 things.

Boolean algebra, named after George Boole, deals with logical operations using two values, typically represented as true and false, or 1 and 0. These values are used for logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.

Given that Boolean algebra operates with two values and binary refers to a system with two components, it is accurate to describe Boolean algebra as binary because it deals with a two-value system.

Did Mike Tyson train to use the gogoplata?,"['Mike Tyson is a boxer', 'The gogoplata is a chokehold used in mixed martial arts and various submission grappling disciplines']","First, consider Mike Tyson's profession: he is a boxer. Boxers typically train in techniques specific to boxing, such as punches, footwork, and head movement. The gogoplata, on the other hand, is a chokehold used in mixed martial arts and submission grappling disciplines, which are different from boxing. It is not common for boxers to train in such techniques unless they transition to mixed martial arts or other combat sports that incorporate ground fighting.

Could a Jujutsu expert hypothetically defeat a Janissary?,"['Jujutsu is a form of unarmed combat.', 'Janissaries were the elite infantry of the Ottoman Empire.', 'Janissaries wore chain mail and armor and wielded sharp swords.']","First, consider the skills of a Jujutsu expert: they are trained in unarmed combat techniques, focusing on joint locks, throws, and submissions to neutralize opponents without weapons. 

Next, consider the equipment and training of a Janissary: they were heavily armored infantry, wearing chain mail and other protective gear, and they fought with sharp swords, indicating training in swordsmanship and likely other forms of combat.

In a hypothetical confrontation, the Jujutsu expert would be at a significant disadvantage against an armored Janissary armed with a sword. The armor would provide protection against many jujutsu techniques, and the sword would be a deadly weapon against an unarmed opponent.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Is calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles a preposterous claim?,"['ABBA was a Swedish band that had 1 Billboard number 1 hit and 4 top 10 hits.', 'The Beatles had 20 Billboard number 1 hits and 34 top 10 hits.']","First, compare the chart success of ABBA and The Beatles: ABBA had 1 Billboard number 1 hit and 4 top 10 hits, while The Beatles had 20 Billboard number 1 hits and 34 top 10 hits. The Beatles' success was significantly greater in terms of number of hits and overall impact on the music industry. Calling ABBA the ""Swedish Beatles"" might be seen as an exaggeration or a stretch given the disparity in their chart achievements.

Would the Ku Klux Klan welcome Opal Tometi into their group?,"['The Ku Klux Klan is an American white supremacist hate group whose primary targets are African Americans, as well as Jews, immigrants, leftists, and homosexuals.', 'Opal Tometi is an African American woman.', 'Opal Tometi is a co-founder of Black Lives Matter.', 'Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people.']","First, consider the primary targets of the Ku Klux Klan, which include African Americans. Opal Tometi is an African American woman. Additionally, she is a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, a movement that the KKK would view as opposing their white supremacist beliefs, as BLM protests against police brutality and racially motivated violence against African Americans.

Given the Ku Klux Klan's history of targeting African Americans and their opposition to groups like Black Lives Matter, it is highly unlikely that they would welcome Opal Tometi into their group.

Did Jane Austen suffer from middle child syndrome?,"['Jane Austen was the second youngest of 8 children.', ""Middle child syndrome is the feeling of exclusion by middle children, due directly to their placement in their family's birth order.""]","First, understand the concept of middle child syndrome: it refers to feelings of exclusion experienced by children who are not the oldest or youngest in their family, often due to their birth order. Next, consider Jane Austen's position in her family: she was the second youngest of eight children, which means she was not a middle child but rather close to being the youngest. Therefore, she would not have experienced middle child syndrome as it pertains to being in the middle of the sibling hierarchy. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do hyenas appear in a Broadway musical?,"[""Scar is the evil lion in Disney's Lion King."", ""Scar's minions are a group of hyenas."", 'There is a Broadway stage version of Lion King.']","First, we know that Disney's Lion King features a character named Scar, who is accompanied by a group of hyenas. Next, we are given that there is a Broadway stage adaptation of the Lion King. It is common for Broadway adaptations of movies to include the same characters and storylines as the original source material. Therefore, since the hyenas are part of the Lion King story and the Broadway show stays faithful to the original, it is accurate to say that hyenas appear in the Broadway musical.

Answer: True.",True
Can an emu chase a bogan?,"['Emus are endemic to the continent of Australia', 'Bogan is a pejorative term for certain citizens of Australia']","First, we establish that emus are fast runners, capable of reaching speeds up to 31 miles per hour (49.8 km/h). Bogan, as a term, refers to a certain type of person and does not provide any information about their running ability. However, since the context implies that both emus and bogans are from Australia, it is possible for an emu to encounter a bogan in the wild.

The key factor here is the comparison of speeds. An emu's top speed far exceeds the average human running speed, which is around 10-12 miles per hour (16-19 km/h). Given this information, an emu could easily outpace a bogan if it needed to chase or evade one.

Would a pacifist be opposed to hunting?,"['Pacifists are a group opposed to violence and war.', 'Amish people are well known for their pacifism.', 'Amish people hunt for meat and sport.']","First, understand the definition of pacifism: it involves being opposed to violence and war. However, this context also provides information about Amish people, who are known for their pacifism but still engage in hunting for meat and sport. This suggests that pacifism may not necessarily extend to a complete rejection of all forms of violence or conflict, as it can vary among individuals or groups.

Given that hunting can be seen as a form of violence, a strict interpretation of pacifism might indeed be opposed to hunting. However, considering the Amish example, pacifism may not universally include opposition to hunting.

The answer is 'It depends on the specific interpretation of pacifism by the individual or group in question.'",False

Does the United States Department of Education oversee services benefiting undocumented migrants? ,"['The United States Department of Education oversees public education across the United States.', 'Public education is a service.', 'Public education services are given to students of migrant families that may be undocumented.']","First, understand the role of the United States Department of Education, which is to oversee public education in the country. Public education is a service provided to all students, regardless of their immigration status. This includes students from migrant families, some of whom may be undocumented. Therefore, the Department of Education indirectly provides support and services to undocumented migrants through the public education system.

Answer: True.",True
Should cactus soil always be damp?,"['The amount of water a cactus needs depends on the weather and season.', ""When the weather isn't hot, a cactus needs very little water.""]","First, understand that the watering needs of a cactus vary based on the weather and season. In cooler months or when the weather isn't hot, cacti require significantly less water. Keeping cactus soil damp all the time is not ideal, as cacti are adapted to arid environments and can suffer from overwatering, which can lead to root rot.

This story suggests a shared professional relationship and a friendly dynamic, as Thomas felt comfortable sharing this anecdote publicly.

Since the story is described as ""funny"" and there is no mention of any conflict or animosity between the two, it is reasonable to assume that they were not enemies. Instead, their relationship, if any, was likely one of colleagues or acquaintances who had a lighthearted interaction.

Should you be skeptical of a 21 year old claiming to have a doctorate?,"['The average age that someone gets their doctorate at is 33. ', 'A doctorate takes an average of 8.5 years.']","First, consider the average age at which people typically obtain a doctorate, which is 33 years old. Next, note that a doctorate typically takes an average of 8.5 years to complete. Combining these facts, it is unusual for someone to complete a doctorate at the age of 21, as they would have had to start their studies at around 12 or 13 years old and finish within the standard timeframe. Therefore, it is reasonable to be skeptical of a 21-year-old claiming to have a doctorate. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would an American feel lost due to language barriers at Disneyland Paris?,"['All Disneyland Paris cast members are required to know and speak English.', 'Travelers from England go to Disneyland Paris often without issue.']","First, consider the language requirement for Disneyland Paris cast members: they are all required to know and speak English. This indicates that communication with staff should not be a significant barrier for English-speaking Americans. Second, note that travelers from England, who also speak English, visit Disneyland Paris frequently without issue, suggesting that the park is accommodating to English speakers.

Given this context, an American would likely not feel lost due to language barriers at Disneyland Paris, as there is an expectation that staff can communicate in English, and other English-speaking visitors manage without problems.

Can a snake swallow an M60 Patton?,"['An M60 Patton is an army tank that weighs several tons.', 'One of the largest animals a snake ate was an impala that weighed 130 pounds.']","First, consider the size of an M60 Patton tank compared to the largest animal a snake has been known to swallow. An M60 Patton tank weighs several tons, which is significantly heavier than the 130-pound impala, the largest animal record-ed for being swallowed by a snake. Snakes typically swallow prey whole and rely on their stretchable jaws and flexible bones to accommodate their food. The size and weight difference between an M60 Patton and the largest known prey make it highly implausible for a snake to swallow a tank.

Now, consider each sin in relation to the context:
- Pride: Could be argued if Columbus's actions were driven by a sense of superiority.
- Greed: Definitely, as the demand for gold and resources is a clear indication of greed.
- Wrath: Potentially, if the punishments were a result of anger or vengeance.
- Envy: Not directly addressed in the context.
- Lust: Not directly related to the context.
- Gluttony: Could be seen in the excessive demand for resources.
- Sloth: Not applicable to the given context.

Given that Columbus's actions can be associated with several of the deadly sins (greed, wrath, and potentially pride and gluttony), it is reasonable to conclude that he condoned multiple deadly sins. The answer is 'True'.",True

The cause of the crash was that his car spun out of control after it tapped the car of another driver. The context also mentions that Dale Earnhardt's death was due to a Basilar skull fracture, which is a type of injury typically caused by blunt force trauma, consistent with a car accident. There is no mention of a stroke being the cause of the crash. Therefore, the answer is 'False'.",False

Are all twins the same gender?,"['Identical twins are always the same gender.', 'However, identical twins are very rare. Most twin cases are formed from two different fertilizations during the same conception event.', 'Non-identical twins can be opposite gender or same gender.']","First, consider the types of twins: identical and non-identical. Identical twins are formed from a single fertilized egg that splits, resulting in two embryos with the same genetic material, and they are always the same gender. However, non-identical twins are formed from two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm, which means they can be either the same gender or opposite genders.

Next, divide the total amount of money by the US population to see how much each American would receive if the bank were to distribute it equally: 2,687 billions / 328,953,020 Americans.
Now, convert billions to dollars for easier understanding: 2,687 billions * $1,000,000,000 per billion = $2,687,000,000,000.
Divide the total dollars by the population: $2,687,000,000,000 / 328,953,020 Americans.
Finally, compare the result to $10: Each American would receive approximately $8,165.45.
Since $8,165.45 is more than $10, JPMorgan Chase could not give every American $10 with their current total assets. The answer is 'False'.",True

Could a white cockatoo have lived through the entire Thirty Years' War?,"[""The Thirty Years' War lasted 30 years"", 'White cockatoos have been reported to live between 40-60 years in captivity']","First, determine the duration of the Thirty Years' War: it lasted for 30 years. Next, consider the lifespan of a white cockatoo: they have been reported to live between 40 to 60 years in captivity. If a white cockatoo were to be born at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, it would need to live for at least 30 years to outlast the war.

Assuming a white cockatoo could live up to its maximum reported lifespan in captivity (60 years), it could potentially have lived through the entire Thirty Years' War if it started its life before the war began and survived until its natural end after the war ended.

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes ideal circumstances and does not account for the challenges a wild cockatoo might face or the reduced lifespan a captive bird might experience due to various factors. In reality, it is less likely for a wild cockatoo to live through the entire war, but not impossible for a well-cared-for captive bird.

The answer is 'True', considering the maximum reported lifespan of a white cockatoo in captivity.",True
Can Planned Parenthood tell your University that you have Herpes simplex virus?,"['Planned Parenthood specializes in reproductive healthcare.', 'Planned Parenthood practitioners are bound by HIPAA to not disclose any patient information.

According to HIPAA, patient information can only be shared with explicit consent from the patient or in specific circumstances allowed by law, such as a court order or to prevent a serious threat to public health.

Given that there is no explicit consent from the patient or a legal exception allowing the disclosure, Planned Parenthood would be bound by HIPAA regulations to keep the patient's information confidential. Therefore, they would not tell the patient's university about their Herpes simplex virus diagnosis without permission.

Were veterans of the War in Vietnam (1945–46) given free education by the Soviet Union?,"['The Soviet Union provided free education to children of those who died in the Vietnam War with America.', 'The War in Vietnam (1945–46) was twenty years before the Vietnam War with America.']","The answer is 'False'. The context states that the Soviet Union provided free education to children of those who died in the Vietnam War with America, which refers to the conflict that took place between 1955 and 1975. The War in Vietnam (1945–46) is a different conflict, occurring two decades earlier. Therefore, veterans of the 1945–46 war would not have been eligible for this specific benefit offered by the Soviet Union related to the later Vietnam War.",False
Have rhinoceroses been killed to improve human sex lives?,"['Rhinoceros horns are used for folk treatment of sexual impotency.', 'Rhinoceroses are killed to remove their horns.']","First, consider the context: rhinoceros horns are used for folk treatments of sexual impotency. This suggests a possible connection between rhinoceros horns and remedies for sexual health. Next, note that rhinoceroses are killed to remove their horns, indicating that there is a demand for these horns that leads to the animals being harmed. Given this information, it is true that rhinoceroses have been killed as part of efforts to improve human sex lives, at least in the context of traditional or folk remedies. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is the Mona Lisa based on a real person?,"['There are two main theories about the origin of the Mona Lisa.', ""The first is that a wealthy noblewoman, the wife of one of Leonardo's friends, sat as the model."", 'Another popular theory is that Leonardo painted her as a cross-gendered self portrait.']","First, consider the two main theories about the origin of the Mona Lisa: one suggests a wealthy noblewoman as the model, while the other proposes that Leonardo painted her as a cross-gendered self-portrait. Both theories involve a person, either real or a representation of the artist themselves. Since both theories center around a person, whether as a direct subject or a representation, it is accurate to say that the Mona Lisa is based on a real person, at least in the sense that her likeness was used as inspiration. The answer is 'True'.",True
Does ABBA have similar gender configuration to The Mamas & The Papas?,"['ABBA was a Swedish pop group composed of four members.', 'The Mamas & The Papas was an American band composed of four members.', 'The members of ABBA are Björn Ulvaeus (male), Benny Andersson (male), Agnetha Fältskog (female), and Anni-Frid Lyngstad (female)..', 'The members of The Mamas & The Papas are John Phillips (male), Denny Doherty (male), Cass Elliot (female), and Michelle Phillips (female).']","First, let's examine the gender configuration of both groups:

Is Mozambique Drill an easy shot for United States Army Ranger?,"['The Mozambique Drill is a close quarters combat technique involving firing two shots to the body and one to the head.', 'United States Army Rangers are equipped with M4A1 guns.', 'M4A1 guns can fire up to 600 meters.']","First, understand the context: The Mozambique Drill is a specific shooting technique used in close quarters combat. United States Army Rangers use M4A1 guns, which have a maximum effective range of 600 meters. However, the Mozambique Drill is employed at much closer ranges, likely well within 25 meters or less, where accuracy is crucial.

Given that Army Rangers are highly trained in marksmanship and close quarters combat, it is reasonable to assume they are proficient in executing the Mozambique Drill at the short distances it is intended for. The drill itself does not necessarily rely on the gun's maximum range but rather on the shooter's skill and ability to quickly engage multiple targets in a life-threatening situation.

The answer is 'True', assuming the context refers to the drill being executed at the appropriate close range for which it is designed, and given the United States Army Rangers' extensive training.",True
Has Justin Timberlake ever written a song about Britney Spears?,"['Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears dated in 1999.', ""In 2002, Justin Timberlake released a music video for his breakup song 'Cry Me A River' and featured an actress who resembled his then ex Britney Spears.""]","First, note that Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears had a relationship in the past. In 2002, Timberlake released a song called 'Cry Me A River' which is generally understood to be about a breakup. The music video for the song features an actress who resembles Britney Spears, which has led many to believe the song is about their split. Although he has never explicitly confirmed that the song is about Britney Spears, the similarities and the timing suggest a strong connection.

Is lunch on the beach a good activity to spot the full circle of a rainbow?,"['The full circle of a rainbow cannot usually be seen from ground level', 'Sometimes the full circle of a rainbow can be seen from a high building or aircraft', 'You can see more of a rainbow the closer to the horizon the sun is', 'Lunch occurs at midday when the sun is likely high in the sky']","First, understand that the full circle of a rainbow is rarely visible from ground level due to the position of the sun and observer. It can sometimes be seen from a high vantage point like a building or aircraft. The visibility of more of the rainbow increases as the sun approaches the horizon. Lunch typically occurs at midday when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.

Given that the sun is likely high in the sky during lunchtime on the beach, it is less probable to see the full circle of a rainbow because the optimal conditions for viewing it would be when the sun is closer to the horizon. Therefore, lunch on the beach is not an ideal activity for spotting the full circle of a rainbow.

Could Eddie Hall hypothetically deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger?,"['The largest cheeseburger ever made weighed 2,014 pounds.', 'Eddie Hall is the former world record deadlift holder, lifting 1,102 pounds under strongman rules.']","First, consider the weight of the largest cheeseburger, which is 2,014 pounds. Next, consider Eddie Hall's personal best deadlift, which is 1,102 pounds under strongman rules. Comparing the two weights, the cheeseburger is significantly heavier than the weight Eddie Hall has lifted. Deadlifting a cheeseburger would not be a typical strongman event, and the format or support structures for lifting such an object might affect the comparison. However, based on the raw lifting capacity, Eddie Hall's personal best is less than the weight of the cheeseburger. The answer is 'False'.",False

After her death, in 1721, he married Anna Magdalena Bach. Since Maria Barbara's death occurred before Bach's marriage to Anna Magdalena, it can be concluded that Bach did not leave his first wife for his second wife; rather, he married Anna Magdalena after his first wife passed away. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do most high school head coaches make as much as the Head Coach at NCSU?,"['The average high school makes about $41,000.', 'The head coach for NCSU makes about $1.8 million dollars.']","First, compare the average salary of a high school head coach with the salary of the Head Coach at NCSU.

These events are separated by over a千年 (thousand years). Therefore, King Arthur could not have been present at the beheading of Anne Boleyn as they lived in completely different time periods. The answer is 'False'.",False

Second, note that the context provided concerns Hindu mythology. Third, recognize that Norse mythology is a separate religious tradition from Hinduism, with its own pantheon of gods. Since Hanuman and Rama are figures from Hindu mythology and not Norse mythology, Hanuman is not associated with any Norse gods. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could the children of Greek hero Jason hypothetically fill a polo team?,"['The Greek mythological hero is known for his quest to obtain the Golden Fleece.', 'The Greek mythological hero had four children: Euneus, Nebrophonus, Mermerus, and Pheres.', 'Polo is a sport played between two teams of 4 players.']","First, we establish that Greek hero Jason had four children according to the context. Polo is a sport played between two teams of 4 players each. Since Jason has four children, it is hypothetically possible for them to form a single polo team with each child playing a position. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can you transport a primate in a backpack?,"['Primates include lemurs, monkeys, apes, and humans.', 'A Capuchin is a type of monkey that are an average height of twelve inches and weighs nine pounds.', 'A school ruler is twelve inches.', 'One school textbook can weigh up to six pounds.']","First, consider the size and weight of a typical primate. A Capuchin monkey, which is a type of primate, has an average height of twelve inches and weighs nine pounds. Comparing this to a school ruler, which is also twelve inches, we can visualize the size of the monkey. Additionally, a school textbook can weigh up to six pounds, which is less than the weight of a Capuchin monkey.

Given this information, it is physically possible to carry a Capuchin monkey, or other similarly sized primates, in a backpack, assuming the backpack is large enough and strong enough to support the weight. However, it's important to consider ethical and legal aspects related to the transportation of animals, as well as the welfare of the primate, which may restrict or prohibit carrying them in such a manner.

The answer is 'True', but with the understanding that it may not be ethical or legal to do so in many circumstances.",True

Next, compare this distance to the distance from New York to Miami, which is over 1,000 miles. Since the distance from New York to Miami is significantly greater than the longest distance a person has ever swum, it is not possible to swim the entire distance from New York to Miami. The answer is 'False'.",False

']","First, consider the forces at the Battle of Actium: Octavian's army had 400 ships, 16,000 infantry, and 3,000 archers. In contrast, the modern Brazilian Navy has over 80,000 personnel, including 16,000 marines, and is equipped with ships carrying explosive torpedoes.
However, it's important to note that comparing a modern navy to ancient naval forces is not apples-to-apples. The tactics, technology, and strategies used in ancient battles are vastly different from those used today. Additionally, the Battle of Actium was decided not just by numbers but also by naval maneuvering, leadership, and the specific conditions of the battle.
Given the significant technological and tactical differences between a modern navy and ancient fleets, it's difficult to say with certainty how the Brazilian Navy would have performed in a hypothetical reenactment of the Battle of Actium. However, it's reasonable to assume that their superior numbers and modern weaponry might have at least influenced the outcome.

The Pledge of Allegiance is commonly recited in various government meetings and public schools across the country, although not in every state. Given that a significant portion of Reddit users are from the US and the widespread practice of reciting the Pledge, it is likely that a substantial number of Reddit users are familiar with it.

However, familiarity may not be universal, as some users might not have grown up in the US, might have attended schools that didn't require the pledge, or might have personal reasons for not participating in its recital.

The answer is 'Most likely True', acknowledging that while not all Reddit users from the US would be familiar with the Pledge of Allegiance, a majority would likely be because of its prevalence in American institutions.",True

Can a carrot receive an organ transplant?,"['Organs are groups of tissues that perform a similar function.', 'The whole of a carrot is a root.', 'A root is a plant organ.', 'You cannot transplant the entire carrot into another carrot.']","First, understand that organs are groups of tissues that perform a similar function. In the context of plants, a root is a type of organ responsible for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. A carrot is a vegetable that consists primarily of a root, which means it is an organ.

Now, consider the statement that you cannot transplant the entire carrot into another carrot. This implies that while a carrot consists of an organ (the root), the context does not suggest attempting to transplant just the root from one carrot to another, but rather seems to refer to the impossibility of moving the complete carrot as an organ transplant.

Given that organ transplants typically involve transferring a specific functional part from one organism to another to replace a damaged or missing organ, and since the context does not suggest分割 or isolating the root from the rest of the carrot, the question seems to be framed in a way that doesn't adhere to the standard definition of organ transplantation.

The answer is 'False', as the concept of transplanting an ""organ"" in the traditional sense does not apply to moving the entire carrot from one plant to another.",False

Since The Invisible Man has had more film adaptations, it is more prevalent in films than Picnic at Hanging Rock. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would someone go to San Francisco for a nature escape?,"['San Francisco is a major US city with over 800,000 people.', 'San Francisco is known for mass transit and being a metropolitan area.']","First, consider the purpose of a nature escape, which typically involves visiting a location with natural landscapes, wildlife, and open spaces. Then, evaluate San Francisco's characteristics as described: it is a large urban city with a significant population and is well-known for its public transportation system and urban features.

While San Francisco does have some green spaces like Golden Gate Park and nearby nature areas like Muir Woods, the city's primary identity is as an urban center rather than a destination for a pure nature escape. Many people might visit for its cultural attractions, architecture, and city life rather than to immerse themselves in nature.

Could amoebas have played a part in the Black Death?,"['The Black Death is a bacterial disease called bubonic plague.', 'Yersinia pestis has been found to grow and thrive inside amoebas.', 'Bubonic plague is caused by Yersinia pestis.']","First, understand that the Black Death, or bubonic plague, is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The context states that Yersinia pestis can grow and thrive inside amoebas. Amoebas are single-celled organisms that can sometimes serve as hosts for other microorganisms.

Given that Yersinia pestis can survive within amoebas, it is plausible that amoebas could have played a role in the transmission or survival of the bacteria responsible for the Black Death in certain environmental conditions, such as contaminated water or soil where amoebas are present.

Woodrow Wilson took 41%, Theodore Roosevelt took 27%, William Howard Taft took 23%, and Eugene Debs took 6%. Adding these percentages together gives us a total of 107%, which indicates that there may have been more than one candidate running or that some votes went to other candidates not mentioned in the context. Regardless, none of the explicitly mentioned candidates took more than 50% of the vote.

Dua Lipa's 2020 album, Future Nostalgia, was described as a disco-influenced album, and there was an article in 2020 about the best disco and funk tracks of that year. This suggests that disco music has seen a resurgence or influence in recent times.

 Is cactus fruit an important menu item for a restaurant based on Cuauhtémoc?,"['The Aztecs cultivated cacti for the fruit', 'Tenochtitlan was the capital of the Aztec empire', 'Cuauhtémoc was the last king of Tenochtitlan ']","First, we need to establish the connection between cactus fruit, the Aztecs, and Cuauhtémoc. The context tells us that the Aztecs cultivated cacti for their fruit, and Cuauhtémoc was the last king of Tenochtitlan, which was the capital of the Aztec empire. It is reasonable to assume that foods cultivated by the Aztecs, such as cactus fruit, would have been a part of their diet and potentially important in traditional dishes.

Given that Cuauhtémoc is historically linked to the Aztecs and their traditions, a restaurant based on Cuauhtémoc might focus on serving traditional Aztec cuisine. Therefore, cactus fruit, being a culturally significant food for the Aztecs, would likely be an important menu item to showcase the authenticity of the restaurant's theme.

Hapshetsut is mentioned as the second known female pharaoh. Pharaohs, by definition, ruled for life and their wealth was buried with them for the afterlife, which aligns with the qualities of a monarch. Since Hapshetsut was a pharaoh, she held the position of the head of the Egyptian monarchy during her reign and ruled for life. Therefore, Hapshetsut would be considered a monarch.

The Gunpowder Plot was an attempt to assassinate King James I, but it failed, and the conspirators were executed. King James I was succeeded by his son, Charles I.

The question asks if the Gunpowder Plot eliminated Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline. Since the plot targeted King James I (Mary's son), had it been successful, it would have affected her bloodline's direct hold on the English throne. However, it failed, and the succession remained intact with Charles I, James I's son, taking the throne after his father.

The answer is 'False', as the Gunpowder Plot did not lead to the elimination of Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline from the English throne.",False

However, the National Board of Ophthalmology does not recognize ABO certification. Kentucky does not have a requirement for ophthalmologists to be certified by the National Board. The context does not mention if Rand Paul maintains an active medical license in Kentucky or if he has obtained any additional certifications required by other states.

New York, on the other hand, has specific requirements for ophthalmologists to be licensed, which includes approved application for licensure certifications. Since Rand Paul's ABO certification is not recognized by the national board and there is no information about him meeting New York's specific requirements, it is likely that he would not be legally allowed to practice medicine, including eye exams, in New York.

Would Arnold Schwarzenegger have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967?,"['In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.', 'Red foxes weigh between 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb).']","First, consider Arnold Schwarzenegger's strength in 1967, as evidenced by his victory in the Munich stone-lifting contest where he lifted a stone weighing 254 kg (560 lb). Next, note the weight of a red fox, which ranges from 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb). Given Schwarzenegger's impressive lifting capability, it is highly unlikely that he would have difficulty picking up a red fox, even at the heaviest end of the fox weight range. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did children read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone during the Albanian Civil War?,"[""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a 1997 children's fantasy book."", 'The Albanian Civil War, also called the Albanian Civil Unrest, happened in 1997.']","First, establish the time frame of both events: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997, and the Albanian Civil War also occurred in 1997. However, the context does not provide information on the availability or popularity of the book in Albania during that time. It is possible that children in other parts of the world were reading the book, but it is not guaranteed that they were doing so in Albania amidst the civil unrest. Without specific information about book distribution and reading habits during the war, we cannot definitively say whether children read the book during that time.

Did any of Maya Angelou's children follow in her footsteps?,"['Maya Angelou was a civil rights activist and author.', 'Maya Angelou had a son named Guy Johnson in 1945.', 'Guy Johnson is an author that has written over twenty books and essays.', ""Guy Johnson's books explore many civil rights themes.""]","First, we identify that Maya Angelou was a civil rights activist and author. Next, we learn that she had a son named Guy Johnson who was born in 1945. Guy Johnson is also mentioned as an author with over twenty books and essays to his name, and his works explore civil rights themes. Given that both Maya Angelou and her son Guy Johnson are authors and engage with civil rights themes in their writing, it is clear that Guy Johnson has followed in his mother's footsteps to some extent.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Do all cancer patients get disability?,"['All forms of cancer qualify as diagnoses that can result in disability.', 'Disability is not determined by diagnosis, but by degree of impairment.', 'Some cancer patients do not experience major impairment.']","First, understand that while all forms of cancer can, in principle, lead to disability due to their potential severity, disability status is not automatically granted based on a cancer diagnosis. It is determined by the degree of functional impairment the individual experiences as a result of the cancer or its treatment.
Second, consider that not all cancer patients experience significant impairment. Some may have early-stage cancer or respond well to treatment, leading to minimal disruption to their daily life.

Given this context, not all cancer patients necessarily get disability, as the decision is based on the specific impact the cancer has on an individual's ability to perform daily activities, not just the diagnosis itself.

Could an NBA game be completed within the span of the Six-Day War?,"['The Six-Day War took place between June 5th-June 10th, 1967.', 'There are 24 hours in a day.', 'An NBA game consists of four quarters that are 12 minutes long and a 15 minute long halftime.', 'There are 60 minutes in an hour.']","First, calculate the total duration of an NBA game in minutes: four quarters of 12 minutes each plus a 15-minute halftime. So, 4 * 12 + 15 = 48 + 15 = 63 minutes per game.
Next, calculate the total duration of the Six-Day War in minutes: 6 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 8640 minutes.
Now, compare the duration of the Six-Day War to the duration of an NBA game: 8640 minutes (war) is significantly longer than 63 minutes (game).
The answer is 'False'.",True
Did Methuselah live at least 800 years as long as Sarah?,"['The biblical Sarah lived to the age of 127.', 'The biblical Methuselah lived to 969 years of age.']","First, we need to calculate the difference in years between Methuselah's life span and Sarah's life span. Methuselah lived for 969 years and Sarah lived for 127 years. 

So, the difference is 969 - 127 = 842 years.

Now, we compare this difference to the statement in the question, which asks if Methuselah lived at least 800 years longer than Sarah. Since 842 years is greater than 800 years, the statement is true.

Did Switzerland support the United States in the Spanish–American War?,"['The Spanish–American War was an armed conflict between Spain and the United States in 1898.', 'Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515.', 'Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.']","First, consider the time frame of the Spanish-American War, which took place in 1898. Next, note Switzerland's policy of neutrality, which has been in place since at least 1515 and was internationally recognized in 1815. Given this policy, Switzerland would not support another country in a military conflict like the Spanish-American War. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would it be difficult for Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei?,"['Kami Rita has climbed Mount Everest 24 times.', 'Mount Everest has an elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft).', 'Mount Emei has an elevation of 3,099 metres (10,167 ft).']","First, consider Kami Rita's experience: he has climbed Mount Everest 24 times, which is the world's highest mountain at 8,848 meters (29,029 ft). This indicates that he is an extremely experienced and skilled high-altitude mountaineer. Next, compare the elevations of the two mountains: Mount Everest is more than twice as high as Mount Emei, with Emei having an elevation of 3,099 meters (10,167 ft). Given Kami Rita's extensive experience at much higher elevations, climbing Mount Emei would likely be significantly easier for him compared to his Everest climbs.

According to the context provided, Rosemary is found in two popular titles (Love Grows and Randy Newman's Rosemary), while Rose is found in several more titles (Kiss From a Rose, The Rose, Desert Rose, Beauty of the Rose, and I Never Promised You a Rose Garden).

Given this information, it can be concluded that 'Rose' is more commonly used in song titles than 'Rosemary'. Therefore, Rosemary can be considered to be outclassed as a plant found in most song titles. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is Bill Gates the wealthiest of the Baby Boomers?,"['The Baby Boomers are the generation born between the years 1946-1964.', 'Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955 and has a net worth of 108 billion as of 2020.', 'Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964 and has a net worth of 160 billion as of 2020.']","First, identify the birth years of the Baby Boomers, which is between 1946 and 1964. Bill Gates was born in 1955, which places him within the Baby Boomer generation. Jeff Bezos was born in 1964, also within the Baby Boomer generation. Next, compare their net worths: Bill Gates has a net worth of 108 billion, while Jeff Bezos has a net worth of 160 billion. Since Jeff Bezos has a higher net worth than Bill Gates, he is the wealthiest among the Baby Boomers. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, understand that ""Goodnight and Go"" is originally an Imogen Heap song. The use of a sample from Imogen Heap's song in Ariana Grande's indicates that Grande's work was at least influenced by Heap's original. The answer is 'True'.",True
Will Futurama surpass the number of episodes of The Simpsons by the end of 2020?,"['Futurama was cancelled in 2013.', 'The Simpsons is still creating new episodes as of May 2020.', 'Futurama aired 140 total episodes.', 'The Simpsons has aired over 600 episodes.']","First, note that Futurama was cancelled in 2013 and has not produced any new episodes since then. The total number of episodes for Futurama remains at 140. On the other hand, The Simpsons is still actively producing new episodes as of May 2020, and it has already aired over 600 episodes. Since no new Futurama episodes are being made and The Simpsons continues to produce them, Futurama will not surpass the number of episodes of The Simpsons by the end of 2020.

Can the Communist Party of the Soviet Union get a perfect all kill?,"['The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a political party', 'A perfect all kill occurs when a South Korean recording artist hits number one simultaneously on every music chart']","The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a political party, not a South Korean recording artist. Achieving a perfect all kill in the context of South Korean music charts is a feat specific to musicians and their songs, not political organizations. Therefore, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union cannot get a perfect all kill. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Bonanza marathon end before WWE Heat marathon?,"['Bonanza had a total of 431 episodes.', 'WWE Heat had a total of 513 episodes.', 'The average run time of WWE Heat was 45 minutes.', 'The average run time of Bonanza was 49 minutes.']","First, calculate the total runtime for each marathon by multiplying the number of episodes by the average runtime per episode.
For Bonanza: 431 episodes * 49 minutes/episode = 21,119 minutes
For WWE Heat: 513 episodes * 45 minutes/episode = 23,085 minutes
Now, compare the total runtimes.
Bonanza: 21,119 minutes
WWE Heat: 23,085 minutes
Since the WWE Heat marathon has a longer total runtime, it would end after the Bonanza marathon. The answer is 'False'.",False

Bush grow up speaking Cantonese?,"['George Bush grew up primarily in Texas.', 'English is the primary language spoken in Texas.', 'Cantonese is the primary language spoken in certain parts of China.']","First, consider George W. Bush's upbringing: he grew up primarily in Texas. English is the primary language spoken in Texas, not Cantonese. Cantonese is primarily spoken in certain parts of China, not in Texas or the United States in general. Therefore, George W. Bush did not grow up speaking Cantonese as it is not the prevalent language in his place of upbringing.

Second, note that every Ford vehicle still bears Henry Ford's last name on the brand logo, which means it is visible to the public whenever a Ford car is seen on the road or in advertisements. Given the global presence of Ford vehicles and the prominence of the brand logo, people still see Henry Ford's last name quite often. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would a thesis paper be unusual to assign to kindergartners? ,"['Kindergartners are usually between 4 and 6 years of age.', 'Kindergartners are tasked with learning the alphabet and how to write their own names.']","First, consider the typical age and educational goals for kindergartners, which are between 4 and 6 years old and include learning the alphabet and writing their own names. A thesis paper typically involves extensive research, critical thinking, and complex writing skills, which are well beyond the developmental abilities of young children in kindergarten.

Given that kindergartners are just beginning to learn the basics of reading and writing, assigning a thesis paper to them would be highly inappropriate and unrealistic given their age and skill level.

Was Eve involved in an incestuous relationship?,"['God made Eve from a bone he removed from Adam.', 'Since Eve was made from Adam, they would have had similar DNA and been considered twins or at least siblings.', 'As the only humans at the time, they ended up starting a family together.']","First, consider the context provided: God created Eve from one of Adam's ribs, making them the first human couple. As the only two people on Earth at the time, they were not biologically related in the traditional sense, as siblings are typically born to the same mother and father. They were not genetic siblings because they did not have the same mother or father; rather, they were created separately by God.

However, the term ""incestuous"" typically refers to sexual relations between individuals who are too closely related by blood or adoption. In the context of the biblical account, there is no information suggesting that their relationship was considered incestuous, as they were the original humans and no other relatives existed.

The answer is 'False', as the term ""incestuous"" does not apply to their unique, divinely created relationship.",True

Next, consider the traditional atmosphere of a funeral, which is typically somber and not conducive to dancing. Given that Happy hardcore is not typically played at funerals due to the contrast in mood and the general expectations for funeral proceedings, it can be considered unusual to play this type of music at a funeral.

Next, understand that Trickle Down Economics relies on rich businesses having control over property and the means of production, with tax breaks intended to benefit them first. Since these principles are fundamentally at odds with the Communist ideology of collective ownership and no private property, it is unlikely that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would support Trickle Down Economics.

Jon Jones, with his purple belt, has significant expertise in the martial art. Additionally, he is an exceptional athlete in combat sports. It is highly unlikely that a white belt, who is just starting their journey in BJJ, would be able to defeat such a highly skilled and experienced opponent like Jon Jones.

Is 1936 Summer Olympics venue too small for a Superbowl crowd?,"['The 1936 Summer Olympics was held at the Olympiastadion Berlin.', 'The Olympiastadion Berlin has a capacity of over 74,000 people.', 'The 2020 Superbowl was attended by 62,417 fans.']","First, consider the capacity of the Olympiastadion Berlin, which is over 74,000 people. Next, look at the attendance of the 2020 Superbowl, which was 62,417 fans. Since the capacity of the 1936 Summer Olympics venue is greater than the attendance of the 2020 Superbowl, it would be large enough to accommodate a Superbowl crowd. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, acknowledge that strong motions in joints with tendonitis can cause nerve damage. Breakdancing is a dance style characterized by intense and forceful movements, and the downrock maneuver specifically places significant stress on the arms and wrists. Given the potential for exacerbating inflammation and the risk of nerve damage in joints affected by tendonitis, it is not advisable for individuals with this condition to engage in breakdancing, especially maneuvers like downrock.

Was Dr. Seuss a liar?,"[""Dr. Seuss was a writer and illustrator of children's books"", ""Dr. Seuss first published a children's book under the name of Dr. Seuss in 1937"", 'Dr. Seuss did not actually have a doctorate or equivalent degree until 1956']","First, we establish that Dr. Seuss was a writer and illustrator of children's books, and he began publishing under that name in 1937. Next, we learn that he didn't receive a doctorate or equivalent degree until 1956. When he started using the title ""Dr."", he didn't have the academic credentials that the title typically implies.

However, it was common for authors at the time to use honorifics like ""Dr."" as a pen name or as a pseudonym, often to sound more distinguished or authoritative. In Dr. Seuss's case, it is not necessarily an intentional deception but rather a creative choice for his professional identity.

The answer is 'False', as there is no evidence to suggest that Dr. Seuss intended to deceive people about his educational qualifications when he adopted the title for his literary career.",True
Is capturing giant squid in natural habitat impossible with no gear?,"['Giant squids live between 1,000 and 3,800 feet in the ocean.', 'With a dry dive suit, a scuba tank, gloves, and so on, divers can reach depths of around 1000 feet.', 'Without scuba gear people can safely dive a maximum of 60 feet without feeling the negative risks associated with diving beyond the limit.']","First, consider the depth at which giant squids live, which is between 1,000 and 3,800 feet. Next, consider the depths divers can reach without scuba gear: a maximum of 60 feet. Given that the natural habitat of giant squids is far deeper than the safe diving limit for humans without scuba gear, it is impossible to capture a giant squid in its natural habitat without any specialized equipment.

Would Dante Alighieri hypothetically place Rupert Murdoch in 8th Circle of Hell?,"['Dante Alighieri was an Italian poet that wrote Inferno.', 'Inferno depicts several layers of Hell.', 'The 8th Circle of Hell is reserved for liars, bribers, flatterers, and false prophets.', 'Rupert Murdoch was involved in a News International scandal in which police were bribed and phones were hacked.', 'Rupert Murdoch refused to take any responsibility for the actions of his employees in the News International scandal.']","First, understand the context of Dante Alighieri's Inferno and the 8th Circle of Hell, which is meant for those who commit fraud, including liars, bribers, flatterers, and false prophets. Next, consider Rupert Murdoch's involvement in the News International scandal, which involved police bribes and phone hacking. Lastly, take into account that Murdoch refused to take responsibility for his employees' actions in the scandal.

Given that the actions associated with the News International scandal align with the category of fraud described in the 8th Circle of Hell, and considering Dante's tendency to place individuals in Hell based on their moral transgressions as depicted in their lives, it is plausible that Dante Alighieri would hypothetically place Rupert Murdoch in the 8th Circle of Hell for his role in the scandal and his refusal to accept responsibility.

Would Saddam Hussein hypothetically choose Saladin as ally over Idris I?,"['Saddam Hussein, President of Iraq, was a Sunni Muslim that brutalized many Shiite Muslims.', 'Saladin was the first Sultan of Egypt and was a Sunni Muslim.', 'Idris I was called the founder of Morocco and was a Shiite Muslim.']","First, consider the religious affiliations of the individuals in question: Saddam Hussein was a Sunni Muslim, as was Saladin. Idris I, on the other hand, was a Shiite Muslim. Saddam Hussein, as a Sunni leader, would likely have more political and religious common ground with another Sunni leader like Saladin. It is also important to consider historical context, as both Saddam Hussein and Saladin were historical figures from different time periods but with similar religious affiliations.

Given that Saddam Hussein brutalized Shiite Muslims and both he and Saladin were Sunni, it is reasonable to assume that Saddam Hussein would hypothetically choose a fellow Sunni, like Saladin, as an ally over a Shiite figure like Idris I.

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, characters practice magic, which could be seen as a form of non-major religion belief or practice. While Christianity and Islam explicitly forbid or harshly punish magic, the context doesn't specify the dominant religion's view in the Harry Potter world. However, historical examples show that those practicing forms of magic have been persecuted by Christians.

Given that the dominant culture in the real world has historically persecuted those practicing magic, it's reasonable to assume a similar attitude might exist in the Harry Potter world, even if the dominant religion is not explicitly identified as Christianity or Islam. Therefore, it's plausible that characters in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone could be persecuted, at least by some, as their magical practices might be perceived as pagan or heretical.

The answer is 'True', considering the historical context of persecution of magical practices and the lack of clear information on the tolerant nature of the dominant religion in the Harry Potter world.",True
Has Aretha Franklin ever collaborated with a suicidal person?,"['Donny Hathaway was a singer and session musician that worked with Staple Singers, Jerry Butler, Aretha Franklin, the Impressions  and Curtis Mayfield.', 'Donny Hathaway jumped from his 15th floor room and his death was ruled a suicide.']","First, we identify the relevant information: Aretha Franklin has worked with Donny Hathaway, and Donny Hathaway died by suicide. The question asks if Franklin ever collaborated with a suicidal person, which implies working with someone after they had expressed suicidal thoughts or had a known history of suicide.

However, the context provided does not specify the time frame of Franklin's collaboration with Hathaway in relation to Hathaway's suicidal actions. It is possible they collaborated before Hathaway's death, but there is no information to indicate if Franklin was aware of Hathaway's suicidal state during their collaboration or if the collaboration took place after he had expressed suicidal thoughts.

Without more specific information about the timeline of their collaboration and Hathaway's mental state at the time, we cannot definitively say that Aretha Franklin collaborated with a suicidal person.

Does butter industry survive cow extinction?,"['Butter is a dairy product made from milk.', 'Cows are the predominant source of milk in the US.', 'Goats, sheep, buffalo, and other mammals produce milk.', ""Goat butter, made from 100% Goat's Milk, is an excellent source of Vitamin A.""]","First, we establish that butter is a product derived from milk. While cows are the primary source of milk in the US, other mammals like goats, sheep, buffalo, and others also produce milk. Goat butter, for example, is made from goat's milk and is known to be a source of Vitamin A.

Given that there are alternative sources of milk available, if cows were to become extinct, the dairy industry, including the production of butter, could potentially adapt by utilizing milk from these other mammals. Therefore, the butter industry would likely survive in some form if cows were to go extinct.

Can Centurylink max internet plan upload 1000GB in a fortnight?,"['A fortnight refers to a period of two weeks.', ""Centurylink's max internet plan speed is 1,000MB per second."", '1000GB takes 2.5 hours to upload for every 1000MB speed.']","First, calculate the total time required to upload 1000GB at a speed of 1000MB per second. Given that 1000GB is equivalent to 1000,000MB, we can divide the total number of megabytes by the speed in megabytes per second to find the time in seconds:

1000,000MB / 1000MB per second = 1000 seconds

Now, convert the time from seconds to hours:

1000 seconds / 3600 seconds per hour = 0.2778 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the number of days required for the upload:

0.2778 hours per GB * 1000GB = 277.8 hours

Now, convert the hours to days in a fortnight (14 days):

277.8 hours / 24 hours per day = 11.575 days

Given that a fortnight is exactly 14 days, we can determine if the upload can be completed within that time frame:

11.575 days < 14 days

The upload of 1000GB can be completed within a fortnight. The answer is 'True'.",True

Did Solomon make up bigger percentage of Islamic prophets than Kings of Judah?,"['According to The Quran, Solomon was one of 25 prophets.', 'According to some Islamic hadiths, there have been as many as 124,000 prophets.', 'Solomon was one of 20 Kings of Judah.']","First, calculate the percentage of prophets Solomon represents out of the total number of prophets mentioned in the Quran and hadiths. According to the Quran, there are 25 prophets, and Solomon is one of them. According to some Islamic hadiths, there are 124,000 prophets. To find the percentage, we'll use Solomon's count in the Quran since it's a smaller set and will give a higher percentage if he were to represent a bigger proportion.

Percentage of prophets Solomon represents = (Number of prophets Solomon is among / Total number of prophets according to the Quran) * 100
Percentage of prophets = (1 / 25) * 100 = 4%

Next, calculate the percentage of kings Solomon represents out of the total kings of Judah. Solomon was one of 20 kings.

Percentage of kings Solomon represents = (Number of kings Solomon is among / Total number of kings of Judah) * 100
Percentage of kings = (1 / 20) * 100 = 5%

Comparing the two percentages, Solomon represents a smaller percentage of Islamic prophets (4%) than Kings of Judah (5%).

Would Roman Gallic Wars army struggle to build the pyramids faster?,"['The pyramids were built by an estimated 30,000 workers.', 'The Roman Gallic war army had around 75,000 soldiers.']","First, consider the number of workers involved in building the pyramids, which is estimated to be around 30,000. Next, consider the size of the Roman Gallic war army, which had approximately 75,000 soldiers. While the Roman army has more people, building the pyramids involves specialized tasks like quarrying, shaping, and lifting massive stone blocks, which may not be skills that the average soldier possesses. Additionally, the organization and engineering required for pyramid construction were highly specialized for that time.

However, if we assume that the Roman soldiers could be trained or adapted to perform the necessary tasks and that they had access to the same resources and knowledge as the ancient Egyptians, their larger numbers might potentially allow them to work faster. But without knowledge of ancient Egyptian construction techniques and methods, it's unlikely they would be able to match the efficiency and precision of the pyramid builders.

The answer is 'False', as the Roman Gallic Wars army, without proper knowledge and specialized tools, would not necessarily be able to build the pyramids faster than the estimated 30,000 workers who constructed them.",False

Does title of Van Morrison's most played song apply to a minority of women worldwide?,"[""Van Morrison's most played song was the hit Brown Eyed Girl."", 'Between 55 to 79 percent of people worldwide have brown eyes.', 'Brown is the most common eye color.']","First, we establish that Van Morrison's most played song is ""Brown Eyed Girl."" Next, we consider the statistics about eye color: between 55 to 79 percent of people worldwide have brown eyes, making it the most common eye color. Since a majority of people have brown eyes, it would not be accurate to say that the title applies to a minority of women worldwide. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could the Austrian casualties from Seven Years' War fit in Indianapolis Motor Speedway?,"[""There were 373,588 Austrian casualties during the Seven Years' War."", 'The infield seating at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway raises capacity to an approximate 400,000 people.']","First, we need to compare the number of Austrian casualties from the Seven Years' War with the approximate capacity of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's infield seating. According to the context, there were 373,588 Austrian casualties, and the speedway can hold around 400,000 people.

Would Dante have hypothetically placed Nostradamus in 3rd Circle of Hell?,"['Nostradamus was a famous seer and court astrologer.', ""Dante's 3rd Circle of Hell is reserved for gluttons."", 'The 8th Circle of Hell is reserved for frauds.', ""Astrology was seen as a valuable skill during Dante's lifetime."", 'Dante places the mystic and prophet Joachim of Flora in the heaven of the sun.']","First, consider the context of Dante's ""Inferno"" and the circles of hell. The 3rd Circle is for gluttons, and the 8th Circle is for frauds. Nostradamus was a seer and court astrologer, which could be seen as related to the realm of prophecy and knowledge.

Second, during Dante's time, astrology was considered a valuable skill, so it's unlikely that he would have viewed Nostradamus solely as a fraud for practicing astrology.

Third, Dante places the mystic and prophet Joachim of Flora in a positive location, the heaven of the sun, indicating that he could appreciate prophetic and spiritual figures.

Given these points, it seems unlikely that Dante would have classified Nostradamus as a glutton, as the focus of his work was more on prophecy and astrology rather than an excessive indulgence in food. It's also less likely that Dante would have considered him a fraud given the respect for astrological knowledge during his time and his positive view of other prophetic figures.

Therefore, Dante would not have hypothetically placed Nostradamus in the 3rd Circle of Hell for being a glutton. The answer is 'False'.",False

Can a rabbi save the soul of a Christian?,"['Rabbis are spiritual leaders of the Jewish community.', 'Baptism is a necessary Christian ritual for salvation.', ""Any non-Christian can perform an emergency baptism if someone's life is in danger.""]","First, understand the roles of a rabbi and the requirements for salvation in Christianity. Rabbis are spiritual leaders within the Jewish faith, not Christianity. According to Christian doctrine, baptism is a necessary ritual for salvation, and it is typically performed by Christian clergy.

However, there is an exception in Christian teachings: in an emergency situation where someone's life is in danger, any non-Christian can perform a baptism if they have the right intentions and use the proper form, as it is believed that the saving power comes from God rather than the person administering the sacrament.

Given this context, a rabbi, as a non-Christian, could potentially perform an emergency baptism for a Christian if necessary, believing that the act would save the person's soul according to Christian belief. The answer is 'True', but it's important to note that this would be an unusual and exceptional circumstance.",True

Would Edward II of England have been born without Vikings?,"['Edward II was King of England from 1307-1327.', 'Rollo was a Viking who became the first ruler of Normandy.', 'William the Conqueror was the first Norman King of England and the great-great-great-grandson of Rollo.', ""Edward II is related to William the Conqueror through Rollo's granddaughter's line (Empress Matilda).""]","First, we establish the connection between Edward II and the Vikings. Edward II is related to William the Conqueror, who was a descendant of Rollo, a Viking leader. William the Conqueror's rule in England had a significant impact on English history and, by extension, on the subsequent line of English monarchs, including Edward II.

Now, if there had been no Vikings, Rollo would not have existed, and therefore the Norman dynasty, including William the Conqueror, would not have come to power in England. Without the Norman influence, the line of English monarchs might have been different, potentially leading to a different person on the throne in 1307 when Edward II ascended.

The answer is 'False', as without Vikings, it is likely that Edward II would not have been born into a line that ultimately led to the English throne. However, it's important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and history is complex, with many variables that could have changed the outcome even if Vikings had never existed.",False
Could Edward Snowden join MENSA?,"['Snowden scored above 145 on two separate IQ tests.', 'The minimum accepted IQ score for MENSA on the Stanford–Binet is 132, while for the Cattell it is 148.']","First, consider Edward Snowden's IQ scores: he scored above 145 on two separate IQ tests. The minimum accepted IQ score for MENSA on the Stanford-Binet is 132, and for the Cattell it is 148. Since Snowden's score is above both minimum requirements, he would meet the intellectual criteria for joining MENSA. The answer is 'True'.",True
Were French people involved in the American Civil War?,"['The French General Lafayette allied with the American Revolutionaries.', ""Lafayette's army scored several key victories for the rebels.""]","First, consider the context provided: The French General Lafayette was involved in the American Revolutionary War, not the American Civil War. While Lafayette's support was significant for the American cause during the Revolutionary War, the American Civil War took place later, from 1861 to 1865, and involved conflict between the Union (Northern states) and the Confederacy (Southern states) over issues such as states' rights and slavery.

The purpose of this delegation was to oppose the Curtis Act and the Dawes Act. These acts led to the policy of allotment, which divided land among individual Native Americans.

Since the Cherokee people are part of the Four Mothers Society and the delegation worked to oppose the acts that ultimately enabled allotment, it is accurate to say that the Cherokee people, through the Four Mothers Society, did send a delegation to oppose allotment.

Next, note that many Orthodox Presbyterians base their beliefs on the Bible and argue that it prohibits adornment like wigs and jewelry. The 1 Timothy 2:8-9 verse specifically cautions against adorning oneself with such objects. Given these points, it is likely that an Orthodox Presbyterian would object to the 1700s judge's attire due to its perceived violation of biblical teachings on adornment.

Would East India Company prefer China's modern trade?,"['China accounts for 4.6 trillion or 12.4% of global trade.', ""The East India Company took part in half of the world's trade from the 16th to 19th century.""]","First, consider the context of the East India Company's trade activities, which were primarily during the 16th to 19th centuries. In modern times, China is a significant player in global trade, accounting for 4.6 trillion or 12.4% of the total. If the East India Company were still active today, it would likely be interested in engaging with such a large and influential market.

However, the question is about preference, which is subjective. We cannot definitively determine if the East India Company, as a historical entity, would have a personal preference for China's modern trade without speculation. But given the company's historical focus on trade and China's current economic power, it's reasonable to assume they would find value in it.

The answer is 'True', considering the potential benefits for a trade-focused entity like the East India Company in engaging with a major global trade player like modern China.",False

Can ham make a cut seal up quicker?,"['Salt helps cleanse the skin by displacing bacteria in a cut.', '1 Cup of ham contains 1.684 mg of sodium.', 'Salt is a mineral made up mostly of sodium chloride.']","First, understand that the context suggests salt has a cleansing effect on the skin due to its sodium content, which can help remove bacteria from a cut, potentially promoting faster healing. Next, note that 1 cup of ham contains 1.684 mg of sodium. However, consuming ham directly on a cut is not a typical method for wound care. Instead, one would typically use salt or a saline solution to clean the wound.

The context does not provide information on the effectiveness of using ham to directly aid in cut healing. Given that the relevant factor is the sodium content, and ham contains some sodium, it's theoretically possible that the sodium in ham might help to some extent if the meat were to dissolve and release its sodium into the wound. However, it is not a recommended or practical method for wound care.

The answer is 'False', as the context does not support the claim that ham itself can make a cut seal up quicker; it is the sodium content that may have a beneficial effect, but using ham in this way is not a conventional or advisable practice.",True

Is Drew Carey important to the history of wrestling?,"['Drew Carey competed in the 2001 Royal Rumble.', 'The Royal Rumble is one of the Big 4 yearly WWE pay per view events.', 'Drew Carey was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011.']","First, consider Drew Carey's involvement in wrestling: he competed in the 2001 Royal Rumble, which is a significant event in WWE's annual calendar. Second, note that he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011, an honor usually reserved for individuals who have made a significant impact on the sport. Given his participation in a major wrestling event and his induction into the Hall of Fame, it can be concluded that Drew Carey holds some importance in the history of wrestling.

Kennedy was inaugurated in 1961', 'Dolce & Gabbana was founded in 1985']","First, establish the timeline: John F. Kennedy's inauguration took place in 1961, while Dolce & Gabbana was founded in 1985. Since Dolce & Gabbana did not exist in 1961, Jackie Kennedy could not have worn their clothing to her husband's inauguration. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a model be appropriate to star in a LA Femme Nikita remake?,"['La Femme Nikita is a French movie about a beautiful female assassin.', 'Models are known for their beauty and height.', 'Peta Wilson and Maggie Q have played the lead role in La Femme Nikita spinoffs.', 'Peta Wilson and Maggie Q have both done extensive modeling work.']","First, consider the characteristics associated with the lead role in La Femme Nikita: the character is a beautiful female assassin, implying that physical appearance and potentially acting skills are important factors. Models are known for their beauty and height, which aligns with the character's appearance. Peta Wilson and Maggie Q, who have played the lead role in La Femme Nikita spinoffs, have both done extensive modeling work, suggesting that modeling experience has been compatible with the role in the past.

However, the context does not provide information about the acting skills of models in general or if a particular model being considered has the necessary acting abilities for this complex character. While beauty and physical appearance may be advantageous, acting talent and possibly martial arts skills (given the assassin aspect of the character) are also crucial.

The answer is 'It depends on the model's acting abilities and whether they can portray the depth and complexity required for the role of La Femme Nikita.'",True

The answer is 'True'.",True
Would Iggy Pop travel with Justin Bieber?,"['Iggy Pop is a famous punk rocker. ', 'Justin Bieber is a famous pop singer.', 'Punk is a music subculture that clashes against mainstream topics, ideals, and subjects.', 'Pop music is a mainstream form of music constructed to appeal to the masses.']","First, consider the musical backgrounds of Iggy Pop and Justin Bieber: Iggy Pop is associated with punk rock, which is a subculture that often goes against mainstream ideals, while Justin Bieber is a pop singer, representing a mainstream music genre. Given the contrasting nature of punk and pop music, it's less likely that someone from the punk scene would choose to associate closely with a pop star.

However, it's important to note that personal preferences and relationships can transcend genre boundaries. It's not impossible for individuals from different music worlds to interact or even travel together based on personal connections or professional collaborations.

Without specific information about their personal relationship or a professional context that would bring them together, it's difficult to definitively say whether Iggy Pop would travel with Justin Bieber based solely on their musical backgrounds.

The Greatest of All Time tournament.']","First, define a quadragenarian as someone in their 40s. Next, consider the general trend that memory can decline with age. However, the context also specifies that memory loss typically becomes more significant for people over 50, not specifically for those in their 40s. Additionally, the example of Ken Jennings, a successful contestant on Jeopardy! at age 46, demonstrates that high cognitive function, including memory, can still be maintained in one's 40s. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize that quadragenarians have little memory capacity. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was the Eiffel tower used as a symbol of the French Revolution?,"['The French Revolution took place 1789-1799.', 'The Eiffel Tower was built a century later in 1888.']","The Eiffel Tower was built in 1888, which is more than a century after the French Revolution (1789-1799).

Second, take into account the direct quote attributed to him, stating that genetic testing ""proves"" that Africans aren't as smart. This statement implies a belief in inherent intellectual inferiority based on genetics.

Given Watson's profession and the content of the quote, it can be inferred that he holds the belief that Africans are intellectually inferior to Europeans, at least in part due to genetic factors. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would Carolina Reaper decrease sales if added to all US salsa?,"['On average, Americans prefer milder salsa than Europeans.', 'The Carolina Reaper is the hottest pepper in the world.

Next, take into account the extreme heat of the Carolina Reaper, which is rated at 2,200,000 Scoville Heat Units, making it the hottest pepper in the world. It is reasonable to assume that introducing such an extremely spicy ingredient to all US salsa would likely deter many consumers who prefer milder flavors. Therefore, it is likely that sales would decrease due to the increased heat level. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would fans of Jonathan Larson be unaware of HIV?,"['Jonathan Larson died of AIDS in 1996.', 'Jonathan Larson produced music and plays about HIV, AIDS, and poverty.']","First, consider Jonathan Larson's work: he produced music and plays that addressed topics such as HIV, AIDS, and poverty. Given the subject matter of his productions, it is likely that his fans would be exposed to information about HIV through his work. Additionally, Larson's untimely death in 1996 due to AIDS would have been a significant event that might have drawn attention to the issue among his fanbase.

Answer: 'False'. It is unlikely that fans of Jonathan Larson would be unaware of HIV, given the focus of his artistic work and the circumstances of his death.",False

Will Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley score same amount of Bacon Number points?,"['The Bacon Number refers to a game in which people find how close a person is to the actor Kevin Bacon based on similar costars.', 'Margaret Qualley was in Novitiate with Julianne Nicholson who was in Black Mass with Kevin Bacon (Bacon Number of 2).', ""Al Pacino was in The Devil's Advocate with Charlize Theron who was in Trapped with Kevin Bacon (Bacon Number of 2)."", 'The further away someone is from Kevin Bacon, the more points scored in Bacon Number.', 'Major General William Rufus Shafter is believed to produce the highest Bacon Number score of 10.']","First, we need to determine the Bacon Number for both Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley. According to the context, Margaret Qualley has a Bacon Number of 2 (Novitiate to Julianne Nicholson to Kevin Bacon), and Al Pacino also has a Bacon Number of 2 (The Devil's Advocate to Charlize Theron to Kevin Bacon). Since both have a Bacon Number of 2, they are equally close to Kevin Bacon.

The context also states that the further away someone is from Kevin Bacon, the more points scored in the Bacon Number game. However, since both Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley have the same distance (2 steps), they would score the same number of points in this game.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Was  Godfrey of Bouillon an Islamaphobe?,"["" Godfrey of Bouillon lead troops during the Prince's Crusade."", 'The Prince\'s Crusade was an attempt by Europeans to ""take back"" the city of Jerusalem from Islamic hands.']","First, understand the context: Godfrey of Bouillon led troops during the Prince's Crusade, which aimed to reclaim Jerusalem from Islamic control. The Crusades were a series of military campaigns initiated by Christians with the primary goal of reclaiming holy sites, particularly Jerusalem, from Muslim control.

Given that the Crusades were fought against Islamic forces and aimed to reverse Islamic rule in the Holy Land, it is reasonable to infer that those leading such campaigns might have held negative views or suspicions towards Islam and Muslims. Godfrey of Bouillon, as a key figure in the Prince's Crusade, would likely have been motivated by these broader objectives and sentiments of the time.

However, it's important to note that ""Islamaphobe"" is a modern term and might not be historically accurate or applicable to the mindset of someone from the medieval period. People during that time might have had different motivations and attitudes that might not align perfectly with contemporary concepts.

Nonetheless, considering the context of the Crusades and Godfrey's role in them, it is likely that he held negative views towards Islam and Muslims to some extent.

The answer is 'True', but with the understanding that the term ""Islamaphobe"" is applied in a modern context and might not be historically precise.",True
Is it possible that June got its name from mythology?,"['June may have been named after Juno.', 'Juno was a Roman goddess and wife of the Roman king of the gods Jupiter.']","First, consider the context provided: June might have been named after Juno, a Roman goddess.

Kabushiki gaisha, as defined, refers to a type of company that operates with stocks that can be traded. Since Canon, Inc. is listed on a stock exchange, it implies that it is a company with publicly traded stocks. Therefore, Canon, Inc. would be a Kabushiki gaisha. The answer is 'True'.",True
Did France win the French Revolution?,"['The French Revolution was a period of  social and political upheaval in France and its colonies.', 'War is an intense military conflict between two states.', 'The French Revolution involved only France as citizens overthrew the monarchy.']","The French Revolution was not a war between two states but rather a internal political uprising within France. It led to the overthrow of the monarchy and significant social and political changes within the country. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that ""France won the French Revolution"" in the context of a traditional victory in a military conflict. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can a diamond float on water?,"[""Diamonds are formed by extreme heat and pressure being applied to carbon under the earth's crust."", 'The density of a diamond is 3.51 g/cm³.', 'The density of water is 997 kg/m³.', 'A diamond is more dense than water.', 'A diamond will sink in water.']","First, consider the density of a diamond, which is given as 3.51 g/cm³. The density of water is provided as 997 kg/m³. To compare densities, we need to convert the diamond's density to the same unit as water's density. 1 g/cm³ is equal to 1000 kg/m³ (since 1 cm³ = 0.000001 m³). So, the diamond's density in kg/m³ is 3.51 * 1000 = 3510 kg/m³.

Now, compare the densities: diamonds have a density of 3510 kg/m³, while water has a density of 997 kg/m³. Since the diamond is more dense than water, it will sink in water rather than float.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Is it possible to get killed walking to the Very Large Telescope?,"['The Very Large Telescope is in the Atacama Desert', 'The Atacama Desert is the driest hot desert in the world.']","First, consider the location of the Very Large Telescope: it is situated in the Atacama Desert. Next, note the characteristic of the Atacama Desert mentioned, which is that it is the driest hot desert in the world. While extreme heat and aridity can pose risks to hikers, it is not inherently common or expected for someone to be ""killed"" simply by walking to the telescope due to these conditions. Death in such environments is more likely to result from dehydration, heatstroke, or getting lost rather than an inherent lethal danger. However, it's important to consider that accidents can happen, and there could be other unforeseen circumstances.

The answer is 'True' with the understanding that the risk is low and primarily related to environmental hazards rather than the site itself.",True
Could Reza Shah be related to Queen Elizabeth I?,"['Queen Elizabeth I was from English parents.', 'Reza Shah was Mazanderani.', 'Mazanderani people are indigenous people of Iran.', 'Iran is nearly 4,000 miles from England.']","First, consider the ethnic backgrounds of Queen Elizabeth I and Reza Shah: Queen Elizabeth I was of English descent, while Reza Shah was of Mazanderani origin. Mazanderani people are indigenous to Iran. Queen Elizabeth I's ancestry is rooted in England, which is geographically distant from Iran, where the Mazanderani people are from. There is no historical record or known connection linking the royal families of England and Iran during the time periods of their reigns.

Given the geographical distance between England and Iran, the distinct ethnic backgrounds, and the lack of historical records indicating a familial relationship, it is highly unlikely that Reza Shah could be related to Queen Elizabeth I.

Given these numbers, it is clear that her pop albums have significantly more sales. It is reasonable to assume that the majority of fans are drawn to her pop music rather than her gospel music based on these sales figures.

Can someone with celiac disease have potato vodka?,"['Celiac disease makes it unsafe for someone to eat gluten.', 'Potato vodka is a gluten free product.']","First, understand the condition of celiac disease, which requires avoiding gluten. Next, recognize that potato vodka is made from potatoes and is, therefore, a gluten-free product. Since gluten consumption is the issue for individuals with celiac disease, and potato vodka does not contain gluten, it would be safe for them to consume. The answer is 'True'.",True
Are cucumbers often found in desert?,"['Cucumbers are a kind of vegetable.', 'With the exception of carrot cake, deserts are not typically made with vegetables.', 'Cucumbers are not the vegetable used in carrot cake.']","First, cucumbers are classified as vegetables, not desserts. Second, desserts are generally not made with vegetables, with the exception of carrot cake, which uses carrots but not cucumbers. Therefore, cucumbers are not commonly found in desserts. The answer is 'True'.",False
Are deaf people left out of enjoying music?,"['Deafness exists on a spectrum of total hearing loss to partial hearing loss.', 'Individuals with total hearing loss can still enjoy the bass and beat of music through vibration.', 'Deaf people with cochlear implants can hear music, albeit in a different way than hearing people.']","First, consider the different levels of deafness: it exists on a spectrum from total hearing loss to partial hearing loss. People with total hearing loss can still experience music through vibrations, which can allow them to enjoy the bass and beat. Additionally, deaf individuals with cochlear implants can perceive music, even if the experience is different from that of hearing people. 

Given this context, deaf people are not entirely left out of enjoying music, as they can still engage with it through various means depending on their level of hearing loss and available assistive technologies. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is it bad to have lactic acid in your body?,"['The body naturally produces and uses lactic acid to convert glucose into energy', 'Lactic acid bacteria are particularly good for digestive health.']","The body naturally produces lactic acid as a normal part of metabolism, and it plays a role in energy production. Additionally, lactic acid bacteria are beneficial for digestive health. Therefore, having lactic acid in your body is not inherently bad; it is a natural byproduct of processes that support overall health. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could all of the famous Apollo's hypothetically defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's?,"[""The famous D'artagnan was a musketeer based on a count that served Louis XIV"", ""There are at least three famous Apollo's: Apollo Creed, Apollo (Greek mythology), and Apollo Crews."", 'Apollo, the Greek god of the sun and healing, is immortal.']","First, consider the context provided: there are three famous Apollos - Apollo Creed (a fictional boxer), Apollo from Greek mythology (an immortal god), and Apollo Crews (a professional wrestler). On the other hand, D'Artagnan is a single historical figure, a musketeer who served Louis XIV.

We can analyze each Apollo's abilities separately:
- Apollo Creed is a skilled boxer, but he is a fictional character and would not have the same advantages in a real fight as in a movie.
- Apollo from Greek mythology is immortal and possesses various godly powers, making him近乎无敌.
- Apollo Crews is a professional wrestler, which means he is trained in combat sports but operates within the realm of entertainment.

Now, comparing them to D'Artagnan, who was a skilled swordsman and fighter but not a god or a fictional character with superhuman abilities.

Given these considerations, it's highly unlikely that all three Apollos (Creed and Crews) could defeat all the famous D'Artagnans (since there is only one) in a fair fight. However, the immortal god Apollo from Greek mythology would be able to defeat D'Artagnan easily due to his divine powers.

The answer is 'False', as the combined abilities of Apollo Creed and Apollo Crews would not be enough to defeat all the D'Artagnans, but Apollo from Greek mythology could.",True
Are blue lips normal?,"['Lips and skin turn blue in response to a lack of oxygen.', ""When oxygen flow is inadequate, someone's health can be in danger."", 'Lips can turn blue due to extreme cold.']","First, understand that blue lips can be a sign of a lack of oxygen or inadequate oxygen flow, which can indicate a health issue. Second, note that blue lips can also occur due to extreme cold, which is a temporary and less severe condition. While not a typical appearance, blue lips can be normal in the context of cold exposure. However, if not related to cold, blue lips are generally an indication of a problem that requires attention. The answer is 'False' (assuming the question refers to blue lips without an apparent cause like cold weather).",False
Does ancient Olympics crown fail to hide tonsure?,"['Tonsure refers to the religious hairstyle in which hair from the top of the head is shaved off.', 'Winners of the ancient Olympics were given a laurel crown to wear.', 'A laurel crown involves leaves arranged in a circle that cover only the edges of the head.']","First, understand that tonsure involves shaving hair from the top of the head, while a laurel crown, awarded to ancient Olympic winners, covers only the edges of the head with leaves. Given that the laurel crown does not cover the top of the head, it would not be able to hide a tonsure. The answer is 'True'.",True
Phileas Fogg's around the world would be difficult to achieve during Pope John Paul I's reign?,"[""Phileas Fogg is a character in Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days."", 'Phileas Fogg attempts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days.', 'Pope John Paul I reigned for only 33 days.']","First, establish the time frame for Phileas Fogg's journey: he attempts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. Next, consider the duration of Pope John Paul I's reign: it was only 33 days. Since 33 days is less than the 80 days it would take for Phileas Fogg's journey, it is possible that Fogg's journey could have started, been in progress, or ended during Pope John Paul I's reign. However, the context does not provide information on when exactly Fogg's journey took place in relation to the pope's reign. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to definitively say if it would be difficult or not for Phileas Fogg to achieve his journey during Pope John Paul I's reign.

The answer is 'False', as there is not enough information to conclude that it would be difficult.",True
Can someone with dermatitis be a hand model?,"['Dermatitis causes rashes, redness, blisters, cracking of the skin, and scarring. ', 'Hand models tend to have flawless skin and hands.']","First, consider the condition of dermatitis: it causes rashes, redness, blisters, cracking of the skin, and scarring. These symptoms are not consistent with the desired appearance of flawless skin for hand models. Second, hand models are specifically chosen for their smooth and attractive hand appearance. Given that dermatitis would likely affect the appearance of the skin negatively, it is unlikely that someone with dermatitis would be able to meet the standards for a hand model.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Can dessert be made with vegetables?,"['A popular desert is carrot cake.', 'Carrot cake is made with carrots.', 'Carrots are a kind of vegetable.']","First, we identify that carrot cake is a popular dessert.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Did Jon Brower Minnoch suffer from anorexia nervosa?,"['Jon Brower Minnoch was an American man who, at his peak weight, was the heaviest human being ever recorded, weighing 1,400 lb.', 'Anorexia nervosa,Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder, characterized by low weight, food restriction, fear of gaining weight, and a strong desire to be thin. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are, in fact, underweight.']","First, understand the context: Jon Brower Minnoch was extremely heavy, weighing 1,400 lb at his peak, which is significantly above a healthy or underweight range. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, food restriction, and a fear of gaining weight.

Given that Jon Brower Minnoch was extremely overweight and anorexia nervosa is associated with low weight and an intense fear of gaining weight, it is not consistent with the symptoms of anorexia nervosa. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff in 2009 baptised?,"[""Huma Abedin was Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff in 2009"", 'Huma Abedin is an American Muslim', 'Baptism is a Christian tradition']","First, we establish that Huma Abedin was Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff in 2009. Next, we learn that Huma Abedin is an American Muslim. Since baptism is a Christian tradition and Huma Abedin is a Muslim, it is unlikely that she was baptized as baptism is not a practice within Islam. However, without specific information about her personal religious practices, we cannot definitively say she was not baptized. The answer is 'Unknown'.",False
Can Roman numerals fill the normal number of Sudoku box options?,"['Sudoku boxes can be filled with one of 9 numbers.', 'There are only seven Roman numerals: I, V, X, L, C, D and M']","First, consider the number of options for filling a Sudoku box: there are 9 possible numbers (1 to 9). Next, look at the number of distinct Roman numerals: there are only 7 (I, V, X, L, C, D, and M). Since there are fewer Roman numerals than the required number of options for a Sudoku box, Roman numerals cannot fill the normal number of Sudoku box options.

Is a Cassowary safer pet than a crane?,"[""Crane's that are fed by humans can exhibit domestic tendencies and rarely peck at humans."", ""The Cassowary, known as the world's most dangerous bird, becomes very aggressive and has even killed humans and dogs.""]","First, consider the behavior of cranes when fed by humans: they can exhibit domestic tendencies and rarely peck at humans. In contrast, the Cassowary is known as the world's most dangerous bird and has a reputation for being aggressive, with instances of killing both humans and dogs. Comparing the two, a crane that has become accustomed to human interaction is less likely to pose a significant safety risk than a Cassowary, which has a natural inclination to be aggressive.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Did any citizen of San Antonio vote for Boris Johnson?,"['San Antonio is a city in Texas in the United States of America', 'Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister of the UK', 'Only UK and commonwealth citizens may vote in UK elections']","First, note that San Antonio is a city in the United States, not the United Kingdom. Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister of the UK, and only UK and Commonwealth citizens are eligible to vote in UK elections. Since citizens of San Antonio are American citizens and not eligible to vote in UK elections, they would not have been able to vote for Boris Johnson in any election. The answer is 'False'.",False
Will Justin Bieber take over Mike Pence's position in 2020?,"['Mike Pence is Vice President of the United States.', 'The Vice President must be a US citizen.', 'The Vice President must be at least 35 years of age.', 'Justin Bieber is a Canadian citizen.', 'Justin Bieber is 26 years old in 2020.']","First, consider the requirements for the Vice President of the United States: the individual must be a US citizen and at least 35 years of age. Next, look at the facts about Justin Bieber: he is a Canadian citizen and 26 years old in 2020. Since Justin Bieber does not meet the citizenship or age requirements for the Vice President, he cannot take over Mike Pence's position in 2020. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does being good at guitar hero make you a good guitarist?,"['Guitar Hero is a game that features a guitar-shaped controller with buttons that the player must hit in time with a song.', 'Guitars as instruments do not have any buttons, but have strings that must be strummed in a particular way to create sound.']","First, consider the difference between the gameplay of Guitar Hero and actual guitar playing: Guitar Hero involves pressing buttons on a controller in rhythm with a song, while playing a real guitar requires plucking or strumming strings to produce sound and often involves knowledge of music theory and technique.
Second, recognize that while Guitar Hero can improve hand-eye coordination and basic rhythm skills, it does not necessarily translate to the physical dexterity, finger placement, or musical understanding required for playing a real guitar.
The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Othello be Shakespeare's play to buy Scheherazade most time with king?,"['Scheherazade was a character in Middle Eastern folklore that delayed her execution by telling the king long stories.', ""Shakespeare's play Othello contained 26,450 words."", ""Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play consisting of 4000 lines and 30,000 words.""]","First, understand the context: Scheherazade delayed her execution by telling long stories. We need to determine if Othello, a Shakespearean play, has enough content to potentially keep Scheherazade storytelling for a significant amount of time.

Othello has 26,450 words. While this is a substantial number, Hamlet, Shakespeare's longest play, has 40,000 words, which is significantly more. However, the length of a play isn't solely determined by the number of words; it also depends on the pace at which the story unfolds and the potential for digressions and elaborations within the narrative.

Given that Othello is a complex and engaging story with multiple plotlines and rich character development, it could potentially provide Scheherazade with enough material to delay her execution for a considerable time, even though it is not as long as Hamlet.

The answer is 'True', considering that Othello, with its intricate plot and character dynamics, could offer enough content for Scheherazade to extend her storytelling.",False
Was Mozart accused of stealing from Richard Wagner?,"['Mozart died in 1791.', 'Richard Wagner was born in 1813.']","First, consider the birth and death years of the two composers: Mozart died in 1791, while Richard Wagner was born in 1813. This means that Mozart was already dead when Wagner was born, making it impossible for Mozart to have stolen from Wagner during Wagner's lifetime. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could you drive from New England to a Sainsbury's?,"['New England is located in the United States of America.', 'The U.K and New England are separated by a large ocean.']","First, identify the locations mentioned: New England is in the United States, while Sainsbury's is a British supermarket chain. Recognize that there is a large body of water, the Atlantic Ocean, separating the two regions. It is not possible to drive directly from one to the other due to the ocean barrier.

Do seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat allowance?,"[""The fat content of one McDonald's hamburgers is 10 grams."", 'The USDA recommends between 44 and 77 grams of fat a day.']","First, calculate the total fat content of seven McDonald's hamburgers: 7 hamburgers * 10 grams of fat per hamburger = 70 grams of fat.
Next, compare this total to the USDA's recommended daily fat intake range of 44 to 77 grams.
Since 70 grams of fat is within the recommended range of 44 to 77 grams, it does not exceed the allowance. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works lucrative?,"['Proofreaders get paid a set rate based on the number of words in a document.', 'Edgar Allan Poe wrote many short stories including the Oval Portrait which is two pages in length.', ""Edgar Allan Poe's only complete novel: The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was a mere 166 pages."", ""A book like Jeyamohan's Venmurasu is 11,159 pages.""]","First, consider the payment structure for proofreaders, which is typically based on the number of words in a document. Next, look at the lengths of Edgar Allan Poe's works: his short stories, like ""The Oval Portrait,"" are very short (two pages), and his only complete novel, ""The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket,"" is relatively short as well (166 pages). In comparison, a book like Jeyamohan's ""Venmurasu"" is significantly longer (11,159 pages).

Given that Poe's works are much shorter than a typical book, the amount earned from proofreading his works would be proportionally less. However, without specific rates for Poe's time or the exact word counts of his works, we can only infer that proofreading Poe's works would not have been as lucrative as proofreading longer books, especially considering the possibility that famous authors like Poe might have had higher rates but still would have had fewer words to proofread compared to longer works.

Can children become lieutenants?,"['Lieutenant the second junior-most or in some cases the junior-most commissioned officer in the armed forces, fire services, police, and other organizations of many nations.', 'Many gangs use military rankings to describe their internal heirarchy.', 'Many young children are inducted into gangs with heirarchies.', 'Children can grow up to be whatever they want to be. ']","First, consider the definition of a lieutenant, which is a commissioned officer rank in various organizations, typically not held by children due to age and experience requirements. Next, acknowledge that gangs may use military rankings, but this does not mean children hold official positions like a lieutenant in the context of legitimate organizations. Lastly, while children can aspire to various careers, the legal and practical limitations prevent them from becoming lieutenants in official capacities.

Would Phineas and Ferb enjoy winter?,"['Phineas and Ferb is a tv show that takes place in the summer time.', 'Phineas and Ferb are students and they get summer break in the summer.', 'They enjoy summer break because of the freetime they have.', 'If it were winter, they would not have summer break.']","First, we know that Phineas and Ferb is a TV show set during summer break, during which the main characters have a lot of free time to enjoy various activities. Winter, on the other hand, is not their summer break, so they would not have the same自由时间 to engage in their typical adventures.

Given that their enjoyment is primarily tied to the freedom and possibilities that summer break provides, it is reasonable to assume that they would not enjoy winter as much because it does not offer the same circumstances for fun and exploration.

Is H's most common two letter pair partner a freebie in Wheel of Fortune bonus round?,"['H forms the most common two letter pair in the English language along with the letter T.', 'The Wheel of Fortune bonus round gives the player six free letters: R, S, T, L, N, E.']","First, identify the most common two-letter pair with H in the English language, which is ""TH."" Next, consider the six free letters given in the Wheel of Fortune bonus round: R, S, T, L, N, E. The letter T is one of the free letters. Since ""TH"" is the most common two-letter pair with H and T is a free letter, H's most common two-letter pair partner is a freebie in the Wheel of Fortune bonus round.

They are not close, and Melissa did not attend Jenny's wedding. Now, consider the context related to SNL: Jenny McCarthy was spoofed on SNL for a rant she did on The View, while Melissa McCarthy is a well-known and frequent guest on the show, receiving multiple Emmy nominations for her appearances.

There is no direct connection or evidence provided in the context that suggests SNL is the reason for Jenny McCarthy's lack of a close relationship with her cousin Melissa. The spoof of Jenny on SNL might have added some tension, but it is not explicitly stated as the cause of their estrangement.

Can Tame Impala's studio band play a proper game of Hot Potato?,"['Hot Potato is a game in which two or more people toss a potato until the music stops.', 'Tame Impala is a band with one member, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker.']","First, understand the requirements for playing Hot Potato: it involves two or more people tossing a potato until the music stops. Next, consider the composition of Tame Impala: it is a band with only one member, Kevin Parker. Since Hot Potato requires at least two players, Tame Impala's studio band, consisting only of Kevin Parker, would not be able to play a proper game of Hot Potato with the traditional format.

Since there are more historically blue states than red states along the route, it cannot be said that US Route 1 is dominated by historically red states. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is tobacco use made to seem enjoyable in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?,"[""In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, one of the characters is a caterpillar that smokes hookah."", 'Hookah is a water pipe used to smoke tobacco products.', 'The caterpillar speaks to Alice while making letters out of the smoke he blows.']","First, we identify the context relevant to the question: In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, a caterpillar character smokes hookah, which is a method of consuming tobacco. The caterpillar's act of smoking is accompanied by a seemingly whimsical action of making letters out of smoke.

Second, we consider whether this portrayal might make tobacco use seem enjoyable: The caterpillar's smoking is depicted with a fantastical element (creating letters with smoke), which could be interpreted as adding an element of curiosity or amusement.

Conclusion: The portrayal of tobacco use in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland might be seen as making it seem somewhat enjoyable due to the fantastical and whimsical context. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is the title of Shirley Bassey's 1971 diamond song a true statement?,"['Shirley Bassey recorded the song Diamonds are Forever in 1971,', 'Over time, diamonds degrade and turn into graphite.', 'Graphite is the same chemical composition found in pencils.']","First, understand the context: Shirley Bassey recorded a song called ""Diamonds are Forever"" in 1971. The question asks if the title of the song is a true statement, considering that diamonds can degrade over time and turn into graphite, which is a form of carbon with the same chemical composition as pencils.

However, the title of the song is a metaphor, suggesting the enduring quality and allure of diamonds. In reality, while diamonds can change forms under extreme heat and pressure, they do not naturally degrade into graphite over time under normal conditions. The song's title is meant to convey the idea that diamonds symbolize eternity and are seen as precious and lasting.

Given that the title is a poetic expression rather than a literal scientific statement, the answer is 'False'. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is overfeeding Lactobacillus unwise for people without dental insurance?,"['Lactobacillus species convert sugars they digest to lactic acid ', 'The lactic acid of some Lactobacillus species is associated with tooth decay', 'Dental procedures can be expensive without insurance']","First, understand the context: Lactobacillus species convert sugars to lactic acid, which can contribute to tooth decay. Dental procedures to treat decay can be costly without insurance.
Second, consider the relationship between overfeeding Lactobacillus (by consuming sugary foods) and the potential for increased tooth decay.
Third, recognize that people without dental insurance may have limited financial resources to cover the costs of treating tooth decay resulting from overfeeding Lactobacillus.

Given these points, it can be inferred that overfeeding Lactobacillus may be unwise for people without dental insurance, as they might be more financially burdened by the potential dental issues it could cause.

Can a cell fit inside of a shoebox?,"['The average shoebox is around 14 inches by 10 inches by 5 inches', 'The average eukaryotic cell is between 1 and 100 micrometers in diameter']","First, convert the dimensions of the shoebox from inches to micrometers for easier comparison. There are 25400 micrometers in an inch. So, the shoebox dimensions in micrometers are approximately 355600 micrometers by 254000 micrometers by 127000 micrometers.

Next, consider the size of an average eukaryotic cell, which is between 1 and 100 micrometers in diameter. This means the cell's volume would be even smaller, as volume is proportional to the cube of the linear dimension.

Given the large size difference between the shoebox and a single cell, it is clear that a cell would fit easily inside a shoebox.

Can Simon Cowell vote for the next Supreme Court judge?,"['The Supreme Court is the highest court in the USA.', 'Simon Cowell is a British talent competition judge.', 'Members of the Supreme Court are appointed, rather than elected.']","First, consider the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court: it is the highest court in the USA. Next, note Simon Cowell's nationality and profession: he is a British talent competition judge. Lastly, understand how Supreme Court judges are appointed: they are appointed, not elected, and thus the process does not involve general voting.

Since Simon Cowell is not a US citizen and the Supreme Court judges are appointed and not elected, he does not have a role in voting for the next Supreme Court judge. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is nickel a better payout than mercury if given a dollar per atomic number?,"['Nickel is a metallic substance with the chemical atomic number of 28.', 'Mercury is a silvery liquid substance with a chemical number of 80.']","First, we need to compare the atomic numbers of nickel and mercury. Nickel has an atomic number of 28, and mercury has an atomic number of 80. If the payout is based on the dollar per atomic number, we would calculate the value for each element by assigning $1 for each atomic number.

For nickel: $1 * 28 = $28
For mercury: $1 * 80 = $80

Given a dollar per atomic number, mercury would provide a higher payout than nickel.

Does Pikachu like Charles Darwin?,"['Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution', 'Pikachu is a Pokemon', 'Pokemon rely on evolution in order to transform into stronger forms']","First, understand the context: Charles Darwin is known for his theory of evolution, which suggests that species change over generations through natural selection. Pikachu is a Pokemon, and in the Pokemon universe, creatures do evolve into stronger forms through various methods, including natural evolution.

Given that Pikachu's nature as a Pokemon involves evolution, it can be inferred that Pikachu's existence and development would be aligned with the principles Charles Darwin proposed. However, it's important to note that Pikachu is a fictional character and doesn't have personal preferences or emotions.

The answer is 'False', as the concept of liking or disliking does not apply to a fictional character like Pikachu. The connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin is more about the thematic alignment of their respective evolutions rather than any personal feelings.",True

Was Dioskourides a lapidary?,"['A lapidary is a person or machine who cuts gemstones; classically, it refers to a person who engraves gemstones.', 'Dioskourides put his signature on a Roman amethyst ringstone with a portrait of Demosthenes circa late 1st century BC.', 'Artists sign their work.']","First, understand the definition of a lapidary: a person who cuts or engraves gemstones. Next, consider the context about Dioskourides: he signed a Roman amethyst ringstone with a portrait of Demosthenes, which implies that he was involved in the creation or engraving of the gemstone. Artists often sign their work, and Dioskourides' signature on the ringstone suggests he was the one who created or engraved it. Given that Dioskourides worked on a gemstone and left his signature, it is likely that he was a lapidary. The answer is 'True'.",True
Was England directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict?,"['The Arab-Israeli conflict began hundreds of years ago.', 'England occupied what is now Israel until 1945 when Israel became independent.', ""During Israel's war for independence England allied with their Arab neighbors to fight the Israeli rebels.""]","First, understand the context: the Arab-Israeli conflict has a long history, and England had a role in the region when it occupied what is now Israel until 1945. England actively supported Arab neighbors during Israel's war for independence.

Given this information, England was directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly during the early stages when they took a side against the Israeli rebels. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can an adult male stand on top Donatello's bronze David and touch the Sistine Chapel ceiling?,"[""Donatello's created a bronze David statue that stands over five feet tall."", 'The average height of an adult male is five feet and nine inches.', 'The tallest adult male in history was eight feet and eleven inches.', 'The Sistine Chapel ceiling is sixty eight feet high.']","First, consider the height of Donatello's bronze David, which is over five feet tall. An average adult male is five feet and nine inches tall. Adding these two heights together would result in a combined height of approximately ten feet and four inches. The tallest adult male in history was eight feet and eleven inches, which, when added to the height of the statue, would result in a combined height of approximately fifteen feet and ten inches.

Now, consider the height of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which is sixty-eight feet high. Even with the tallest known adult male height combined with the height of the statue, the total height falls far short of the ceiling's height.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Can you see the moon in Wembley Arena?,"['Wembley Arena is an indoor arena.', 'The moon is located in the sky.', ' You cannot see the sky if you are indoors.']","First, consider the fact that Wembley Arena is an indoor venue, which means it has a roof and does not provide a view of the sky. The moon is located in the sky. Since you cannot see the sky if you are indoors, it would not be possible to see the moon while inside Wembley Arena. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could Quartz be useful to humans if plants died off and there was no oxygen?,"['Plants produce oxygen which is needed by humans to survive.', 'Quartz is a hard mineral substance made of several elements.', 'Quartz is composed of silicon and oxygen.', 'Quartz can be melted at high temperatures.']","First, understand the context: plants produce oxygen, which is essential for human survival. In the hypothetical scenario where plants died off and there was no oxygen, humans would need an alternative source of oxygen or a way to survive without it. Quartz is composed of silicon and oxygen, but in this context, the oxygen in quartz is not readily available for respiration.

Next, consider the properties of quartz: it is a hard mineral that can be melted at high temperatures. While this might suggest potential industrial uses, such as in glass production or electronics, it does not address the need for oxygen in the scenario presented.

The answer is 'False'. Quartz, by itself, would not be directly useful to humans in terms of providing oxygen if plants died off and there was no oxygen in the atmosphere.",True
Is the Asian black bear multicolored?,"['The Asian black bear is an animal that lives in habitats with trees.', 'Multicolored refers to anything that is composed of more than one color.', 'The Sian black bear has a black coat with a white V-shaped patch.']","First, we need to understand the description of the Asian black bear's coat. According to the context, the Asian black bear has a ""black coat with a white V-shaped patch."" This indicates that the bear's primary color is black, but it also has a white marking.

Now, we consider the definition of ""multicolored,"" which means composed of more than one color. The presence of both black and white on the Asian black bear's coat satisfies this definition.

Therefore, the Asian black bear can be considered multicolored due to the combination of black and white on its coat. The answer is 'True'.",True
Does Homer Simpson need two hands worth of fingers to count to 5?,"['Homer Simpson is a character of the long running comedy animated series ""The Simpsons"".', 'All characters in ""The Simpsons"" have 4 fingers on each hand.']","First, we establish that all characters in ""The Simpsons,"" including Homer Simpson, have 4 fingers on each hand. To count to 5 using only the fingers from one hand, Homer would need to use all four fingers and combine them with the thumb from his other hand. Since he has four fingers on his dominant hand, he wouldn't need to use both hands for this task. The answer is 'False'.",True
Does Robert De Niro use a microscope at work?,"['A microscope is a tool used by scientists.', 'Robert De Niro works on movies and television shows, and he is not a scientist.']","First, consider the purpose of a microscope, which is a tool used by scientists. Next, note that Robert De Niro is an actor who works on movies and television shows, not a scientist. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would use a microscope as part of his work. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does open heart surgery finish before entirety of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake?,"[""The American Ballet theatre's Swan Lake has a run time of 145 minutes."", 'The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute states that a coronary artery bypass takes 3 to 6 hours']","First, consider the duration of both events: American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake has a run time of 145 minutes, while a coronary artery bypass surgery, which is a type of open heart surgery, takes 3 to 6 hours. Convert the surgery duration to minutes for comparison: 3 hours is 180 minutes and 6 hours is 360 minutes.
Next, compare the durations: 145 minutes (Swan Lake) is less than or within the range of 180 to 360 minutes (open heart surgery).
Therefore, open heart surgery would not necessarily finish before the entirety of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake performance. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can United States Secretary of State do crimes in U.K. without being arrested?,"['Diplomatic Immunity allows for diplomats in other countries to not be tried for their transgressions.', 'Countries that signed the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations allow for Diplomatic Immunity.', 'All UN member states besides Palau, The Solomon Islands, and South Sudan have signed the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations treaty.', 'The U.K. is one of the original UN member nations.']","First, understand that Diplomatic Immunity provides protection to diplomats from being prosecuted in the countries where they are stationed. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which has been signed by almost all UN member states, including the U.K., establishes this principle.

Given that the United States is also a UN member state and thus likely adheres to the Vienna Convention, the Secretary of State, as a diplomat, would generally enjoy diplomatic immunity while in the U.K.

However, immunity can be waived by the host country in certain circumstances, such as if the diplomat is accused of a serious crime.

In summary, under normal circumstances and without a waiver of immunity by the U.K., the United States Secretary of State could commit a crime in the U.K. without being immediately arrested due to diplomatic immunity. The answer is 'True', considering the standard application of diplomatic immunity unless there is an exception involving a waiver by the host nation.",True
Would Gordon Ramsey use uranium as a seasoning?,"['Gordon Ramsey is a chef known for producing high quality food ', 'Uranium is a toxic and weakly radioactive metal']","First, consider Gordon Ramsay's profession as a chef focused on high-quality food. Second, recognize that uranium is a toxic and radioactive metal, which is not safe for consumption. Given these facts, it is highly unlikely that a professional chef like Ramsay would use uranium as a seasoning due to its harmful properties. The answer is 'False'.",False

Is Rand Paul guilty of catch-phrase used to attack John Kerry in 2004?,"['John Kerry was attacked by his opponents in the 2004 Presidential Campaign by being called a Flip-Flopper.', 'A Flip-Flopper is someone that makes a complete change in policy from one thing to another.', 'In May 2010 Rand Paul called for an electronic fence to keep out immigrants and deplored amnesty in any form.', 'In 2013 Rand Paul said he was in favor of undocumented immigrants being granted  legal status.']","First, understand the context: a ""Flip-Flopper"" refers to someone who changes their policy stance completely. In 2004, John Kerry was attacked for being a Flip-Flopper. In 2010, Rand Paul took a hardline stance against immigration with an electronic fence and opposing amnesty. However, by 2013, Rand Paul had shifted his position to favoring legal status for undocumented immigrants.

Since Rand Paul changed his position on immigration from a more restrictive stance to a more permissive one, he符合""Flip-Flopper""的描述。The answer is 'True'.",True
Should a finished website have lorem ipsum paragraphs?,"['Lorem Ipsum paragraphs are meant to be temporary.', 'Web designers always remove lorem ipsum paragraphs before launch.']","First, consider the purpose of lorem ipsum paragraphs: they are meant to be temporary filler text used during the design and development stages of a website. Second, understand the standard practice among web designers: they typically remove lorem ipsum paragraphs before the website is launched to the public. Therefore, a finished website should not have lorem ipsum paragraphs as they are placeholders and not intended for the final version. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was Robert Downey Jr. a good role model as a young man?,"['As a young man, Robert Downey Jr. struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.', 'Robert Downey Jr. shot a gun out of a car window while doing drugs as a young adult.']","First, consider Robert Downey Jr.'s actions as a young man, which included struggling with drug and alcohol addiction and engaging in dangerous behavior such as shooting a gun out of a car window under the influence. These actions are not typically associated with good role models, as they demonstrate poor decision-making and potential harm to oneself and others.

Would Jacques Duèze have been friends with Richard Dawkins?,"['Jacques Duèze was later Pope John XXII.', 'The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, a Christian organization.', 'Christianity is a religion.', 'Richard Dawkins is a prominent critic of religion.']","First, consider the background of Jacques Duèze: he was Pope John XXII, which means he was the head of the Catholic Church, a Christian organization. Next, consider Richard Dawkins: he is a prominent critic of religion. Given that the Pope represents the leadership of Christianity and Dawkins is a critic of religion in general, it is unlikely that they would have shared a friendly relationship due to their opposing views. The answer is 'False'.",False

Melania Trump was a model before becoming the first lady, and Olga Kurylenko is both an actress and a model. The context states that both women have worked as models. The answer is 'True'.",True
Are pirate lieutenants like navy lieutenants?,"['Lieutenant Richards was a pirate that sailed alongside Blackbeard.', ""Lieutenant RIchards had many duties and was placed in charge of the ship, Bonnet's Revenge."", 'In the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies, the second-in-command of a vessel is known as the first lieutenant.', 'Royal Navy lieutenants are in charge of other crew members and have many duties.']","First, we establish that a pirate lieutenant, like Lieutenant Richards, held a position of authority on a pirate ship, responsible for various duties and in charge of the ship, such as the Bonnet's Revenge. In the Royal Navy, a first lieutenant is the second-in-command and also has responsibilities for overseeing other crew members.

Comparing the roles, both pirate lieutenants and Royal Navy lieutenants have duties that include managing other crew members and being in charge of specific aspects of their respective vessels. However, the title 'first lieutenant' in the Royal Navy implies a clear hierarchical position as the second-in-command, which might not directly translate to pirate ships where hierarchy could be less structured.

Given that the context doesn't provide detailed information on the exact structure and hierarchy of pirate ships, we can infer that while there are similarities in responsibilities, the specific title and role of 'lieutenant' might not have the exact same meaning or rank implications in both naval and pirate contexts.

The answer is 'Maybe', as it depends on the specific pirate ship's structure and the degree to which they followed formal naval ranks and roles.",True

Was Mother Theresa a follower of atheism?,"['Mother Theresa was a Catholic nun.', 'Atheism is the absence of belief in a diety.', 'Catholics believe in the Holy Trinity, which is a representation of God.']","First, understand the key points: Mother Theresa was a Catholic nun, which means she followed Catholicism. Catholicism includes belief in the Holy Trinity, which is a central tenet of the faith and involves belief in God. Atheism, on the other hand, is the absence of belief in a deity. Since Mother Theresa was a Catholic nun, she adhered to the beliefs of Catholicism and therefore had a belief in God.

Would Carrie Poppy be likely to trust a psychic?,"['Carrie Poppy is an American podcaster who is on a show called \'Oh No! Ross and Carrie.""', '""Oh No Ross and Carrie"" is a show that critically examines religious claims and those of the supernatural.', 'Carrie Poppy considers herself a skeptic and an investigative reporter.']","First, consider the nature of the show 'Oh No! Ross and Carrie': it critically examines religious claims and the supernatural. Second, note that Carrie Poppy is a skeptic and an investigative reporter on the show. Given her role and the focus of the program, it is likely that she would approach psychic claims with skepticism and critical thinking. Therefore, Carrie Poppy would not be likely to trust a psychic without strong evidence or a thorough investigation. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is it possible to binge entire EastEnders series without water?,"['British TV series EastEnders has over 6,000 episodes as of 2020.', 'It would take approximately 125 days to binge watch the entire EastEnders TV series.', 'A human can last only 4 days without water.']","First, calculate the duration needed to binge-watch the entire EastEnders series: it would take approximately 125 days. Next, consider the human body's limit for survival without water, which is around 4 days. Comparing the two, 125 days is significantly longer than the 4 days a person can survive without water. Therefore, it is not possible for a person to binge-watch the entire EastEnders series without water as they would not survive the duration without hydration. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does the land in close proximity to beaver dams suffer?,"['Beaver dams often lead to flooding in the areas around them.', 'Flooding can lead to loosening of the soil.', 'Loosened soil can cause trees to fall over. ', 'Flooding can lead to soil erosion.']","First, consider the effects of beaver dams: they often lead to flooding in the areas around them. This flooding can cause several issues, such as loosening the soil, which in turn can cause trees to fall over. Additionally, flooding can lead to soil erosion. All these consequences indicate that the land in close proximity to beaver dams may experience negative impacts.

Since Rachel Carson died before the moon landing, she could not have physically been alive to fly to the moon. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was Jackson Pollock trained by Leonardo da Vinci?,"['Leonardo lived during the Italian Renaissance in the 17th century.', 'Jackson Pollock lived during the 20th century.']","First, consider the time periods of Leonardo da Vinci and Jackson Pollock: Leonardo lived during the Italian Renaissance in the 17th century, while Jackson Pollock lived during the 20th century. These time periods are separated by several centuries, making it impossible for Pollock to have received direct training from Leonardo da Vinci. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Francois Mitterrand ever meet Barak Obama while they both held the position of President?,"['Mitterand was President of France from 1981 through 1995.', 'Obama was President of the United States from 2009 to 2017']","First, we need to compare the time periods when both Mitterrand and Obama held the position of President. Mitterrand was President of France from 1981 to 1995, while Obama was President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. There is no overlap in their presidencies, as Mitterrand's term ended in 1995, four years before Obama's term began.

Would it be difficult for Will Ferrell to win Empire Award for Best Newcomer?,"['The Empire Award for Best Newcomer was awarded for an actor in their debut role.', 'Will Ferrell debuted in 1995.']","First, consider the definition of the Empire Award for Best Newcomer: it is awarded for an actor in their debut role. Next, look at Will Ferrell's acting career start: he debuted in 1995. If his debut was in 1995, and the award is for a新人表演, it implies that he would have had to win the award soon after his debut. However, the context does not provide information on whether he actually won the award or was even nominated in his early years. The difficulty of winning would depend on factors like his performance, competition, and the specific year he was eligible. Without this information, it's impossible to determine if it would be difficult for him to win. The answer is 'Cannot be determined'.",True
Can 1980 United States presidential election result be considered a photo finish?,"['A photo finish refers to a race or finish in which contestants are so close that a photograph of them as they cross the finish line has to be examined.', 'Ronald Reagan had 489 electoral votes while Jimmy Carter had 49 in the 1980 United States presidential election.', 'Ronald Reagan won 44 states while Jimmy Carter won 6 in the 1980 United States presidential election.']","The answer is 'False'. A photo finish typically refers to a very close race where it is difficult to determine the winner without resorting to a detailed examination, such as a photograph. In the 1980 United States presidential election, Ronald Reagan had a significant lead in both electoral votes (489 to Jimmy Carter's 49) and states won (44 to Carter's 6). This margin is not indicative of a close race that would require a photo finish to determine the winner.",False
Did Cynthia Powell celebrate a silver anniversary with John Lennon?,"['A silver anniversary takes place during the 25th year of marriage.', 'Cynthia Powell married John Lennon in 1962.', 'Cynthia Powell and John Lennon got divorced in 1968.']","First, calculate the duration of Cynthia Powell's marriage to John Lennon: they were married in 1962 and divorced in 1968, which is a total of 1968 - 1962 = 6 years.
Next, consider the definition of a silver anniversary: it occurs during the 25th year of marriage. Since Cynthia Powell and John Lennon were only married for 6 years, they did not reach their 25th anniversary.

Are there options for students who struggle to understand the writing style of Othello?,"['""No Fear Shakespeare"" is a line of books that translate the language of original Shakespeare plays into modern English.', 'Scripts can be understood more easily when read alongside a production of the play itself.', '""No Fear Shakespeare"" features Othello in their book lineup.']","First, consider the resources mentioned for understanding Shakespeare's writing style: ""No Fear Shakespeare"" provides modern English translations, and reading a script alongside a play production can aid comprehension.
Second, note that ""No Fear Shakespeare"" has a version of Othello, which means students can access a modernized version of the play.
Third, consider that watching a production can help visualize the story and dialogue, making it easier to understand.

Is MF Doom a Fantastic Four villain?,"['MF Doom is a British rapper raised on Long Island.', 'Doctor Victor Von Doom is a fictional supervillain that made his debut in the Fantastic Four.', 'The MF in MF Doom stands for Metal Face.']","First, identify the subject in question: MF Doom, a British rapper. Next, recognize that the context provided discusses Doctor Victor Von Doom, a Fantastic Four villain. There is no direct connection between MF Doom the rapper and Doctor Victor Von Doom the comic book villain. The abbreviation MF in MF Doom's name stands for Metal Face, which has no relation to the Fantastic Four villain. Therefore, MF Doom is not a Fantastic Four villain. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Confederate States Army influence West Point fashion?,"['The Confederate States Army was clad in cadet gray uniforms.', 'West Point uniforms are cadet gray and white.', 'Confederate States Army uniforms contained Generally, the uniform jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a six to nine button front and hat.', ' West Point uniforms contain a standing collar, white trousers, and black shakos (known as a ""tarbucket hat"" in U.S. Army nomenclature).']","First, we note that both the Confederate States Army and West Point uniforms share the color cadet gray. However, the specific details of the uniforms differ, with the Confederate uniform being described as a single-breasted jacket with a button front and a hat, while West Point uniforms include a standing collar, white trousers, and a black shako.

The similarity in the use of cadet gray might suggest some influence, but it is not clear if the design elements or fashion choices of the Confederate States Army directly influenced West Point's uniform design. West Point's uniform also includes distinct features like the standing collar, white trousers, and black shako that are not mentioned in the context provided for Confederate uniforms.

Without further information on the historical context or specific decisions made in designing West Point uniforms, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the Confederate States Army had a direct influence on West Point fashion.

Is Snow White an example of good consent?,"['Snow White is unknowingly poisoned by a witch.', 'Snow White is unconscious when a man kisses her without her knowledge.', 'Consent involves knowingly allowing something to happen to oneself. ']","First, understand the concept of consent: it involves knowingly allowing something to happen to oneself. In the context of Snow White, she is unknowingly poisoned by a witch and is unconscious when a man kisses her without her knowledge. This means she did not give permission or knowledge for either of these actions to occur. Given that consent requires an individual's awareness and agreement, neither the poisoning nor the kiss can be considered examples of good consent.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Would most grand masters know what the French Defense is?,"['Grand master is the highest title a chess player can get.', 'The French Defense is a well known chess opening that is in many books.']","First, consider the definition of a grand master: it is the highest title a chess player can achieve, indicating a high level of skill and knowledge in the game. Second, note that the French Defense is a well-known chess opening that is covered in many books, indicating it is part of the standard repertoire studied by chess players.

Given the expertise and comprehensive understanding of chess strategies required to become a grand master, it is highly likely that most grand masters would be familiar with the French Defense as it is a common and well-documented opening.

Would an environmentalist advocate for preventing domestic canine reproduction?,"['Domestic dogs are a large contributor to species depopulation and displacement.', 'Domestic dogs have a diet that largely contributes to a harmful environmental impact. ']","First, consider the concerns environmentalists typically have, which often involve preserving biodiversity and reducing negative environmental impacts. Given that domestic dogs contribute to species depopulation and displacement, as well as have a diet that contributes to a harmful environmental impact, an environmentalist might argue for measures to address these issues.

However, preventing all domestic canine reproduction could have unintended consequences, such as creating an imbalance in the demand for pet adoption and potentially leading to the creation of more inhumane solutions like backyard breeding or increased euthanasia rates.

The answer is 'It depends on the specific environmentalist's perspective and priorities. Some might advocate for responsible pet ownership, spaying/neutering, and reducing demand for new pets, while others might consider more comprehensive strategies that balance the environmental impact with ethical considerations for animals and human needs.'",True
Is the tree species that the name Leipzig refers to an evergeen tree?,"['Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk', 'Lipsk means ""settlement where the linden trees stand""', 'Linden trees are deciduous trees']","First, understand the origin of the name Leipzig: it comes from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means ""settlement where the linden trees stand."" Next, consider the characteristic of linden trees: they are deciduous trees, meaning they lose their leaves in the fall. Since deciduous trees are not evergreen, the name Leipzig does not refer to an evergreen tree species. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, consider the number of people in Kate Gosselin's household, which consists of her eight children. Adding Kate herself would make nine people, but that still falls short of the required 11 players for a Bandy team. Therefore, Kate Gosselin's household cannot fill out a Bandy team.

Will Gremlins sequels tie number of Matrix sequels?,"['The Matrix films had two sequels.', 'Gremlins has one sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch.', 'The script for a Gremlins 3 is being written by Carl Ellsworth.']","First, note that The Matrix has two sequels: The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. Gremlins has one sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch. A script for a Gremlins 3 is being written by Carl Ellsworth, indicating that there is a potential for a third film in the Gremlins franchise.

However, the script being written does not guarantee that the movie will be produced and released. Until Gremlins 3 is officially released, the number of sequels in the Gremlins series will remain one, which is less than the two Matrix sequels.

Would Downton Abbey finale viewership defeat every Kazakhstan citizen in tug of war?,"[""Downton Abbey's finale had a total of 9.6 million viewers."", 'Kazakhstan has 18.7 million citizens as of 2020.']","First, consider the number of viewers of the Downton Abbey finale, which was 9.6 million. Next, consider the total population of Kazakhstan, which is 18.7 million people as of 2020. In a tug of war, the total strength of a group is typically proportional to its size. Therefore, if every citizen of Kazakhstan were to participate in a tug of war against the Downton Abbey finale viewers, the Kazakhstan citizens would have nearly twice as many people, giving them a significant advantage in the contest.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Is Michael Vick on People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals's hypothetical blacklist?,"['People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is an animal rights organization that fights for the welfare of animals.', 'A blacklist is a list of people that are unacceptable and should be avoided or excluded.', 'Michael Vick is an ex-football player that spent 21 months in prison for his vicious dog fighting enterprise.']","First, consider the mission of PETA, which is to fight for animal welfare. Next, consider the context of Michael Vick's history: he spent 21 months in prison for running a dog fighting enterprise, which is directly at odds with PETA's values. It is reasonable to assume that an organization dedicated to animal welfare would not support or condone such actions.

Given PETA's focus on animal rights and the severity of Michael Vick's crimes against animals, it is likely that he would be on their hypothetical blacklist of individuals who have committed heinous acts against animals and are therefore not in line with their values.

Would a Gray Whale fit easily in an above ground pool?,"['Gray whales are, on average, 39ft long.', 'The average above ground pool is 10-33ft in diameter. ']","First, consider the size of a gray whale: they are, on average, 39 feet long. Next, consider the size of an above ground pool: the average diameter is between 10 and 33 feet. A whale's length is not the primary concern for fitting in a round pool; rather, it is the whale's girth at its widest point, which would likely be greater than the diameter of even the largest above ground pools.

Is MIX a word and a roman numeral?,"['""Mix"" means to combine in english.', 'M equals one thousand in roman numerals', 'I equals one in roman numerals ', 'I before X in roman numerals equals nine.', 'MIX equals one thousand nine in roman numerals. ']","First, we establish that ""Mix"" is a word in English, meaning to combine. Next, we consider the roman numerals: M equals 1000, I equals 1, and I before X (IX) equals 9. Therefore, MIX in roman numerals would be written as M (1000) followed by I (1) and X (10), which according to the rule ""I before X in roman numerals equals nine,"" would actually be written as IX (9). So MIX in roman numerals would be M(1000) IX(9), not one thousand nine. The context provided is incorrect about the value of MIX in roman numerals.

Will a celibate cleric likely suffer a stoning in Somalia?,"['A cleric is the term for a Muslim priest.', 'Celibate people remain chaste and do not engage in relations with others.', 'Stoning is a penalty in Somalia used to punish adulterers.', 'Many Islamic militants have been in control of various parts of Somalia.']","First, understand the context: a cleric is a Muslim priest, and in this case, we are considering a celibate one who does not engage in relations. Stoning is a penalty in Somalia used specifically to punish adulterers. Islamic militants, who often enforce strict interpretations of Islamic law, have been in control of various parts of Somalia.

Given that a celibate cleric by definition is not engaging in sexual relations, they would not be considered an adulterer. Therefore, a celibate cleric would not be subject to the punishment of stoning for adultery in Somalia. However, the presence of Islamic militants could introduce additional complexities and risks, but based on the information provided about the crime of stoning, a celibate cleric would not typically face this punishment for their celibacy.

Did Holy Saturday 2019 have special significance to pot smokers?,"['Holy Saturday 2019 took place on April 20th.', 'April 20th, known as 4/20 day, National Pot Smokers Day, Weed Day or National Weed Day, is a holiday for pot smokers.']","First, note that Holy Saturday 2019 occurred on April 20th. April 20th is widely recognized as a day with special significance for pot smokers, commonly referred to as 4/20 day, National Pot Smokers Day, Weed Day, or National Weed Day. Since Holy Saturday fell on the same day as this recognized holiday, it would have coincided with a day that holds particular meaning for pot smokers.

Can a sea turtle play tennis using a tennis racket?,"['to play tennis, a human-like hand is needed to properly hold the tennis racket', 'sea turtles have flippers and not human-like hands']","First, consider the requirements for playing tennis: it involves holding a tennis racket, which typically requires a human-like hand with fingers to grip the handle. Next, note the physical characteristics of a sea turtle: they have flippers, not hands similar to humans. Given that sea turtles do not have the necessary appendages to properly hold a tennis racket, they cannot play tennis. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do you need lactobacillus to make pickles?,"['Lactobacillus is used in the production of fermented-style pickles. ', '""Quick"" pickles are made with a mixture of brine and vinegar.']","First, understand the two methods of making pickles mentioned: fermented-style pickles use lactobacillus for fermentation, while ""quick"" pickles are made with a mixture of brine and vinegar without the need for lactobacillus.

Is shoe soup innocuous?,"['Soup is a primarily liquid food containing various meats and beans.', 'Director Werner Herzog lost a bet and cooked his shoe into a soup and ate it in 1980.', 'Werner Herzog turned 77 in 2019 and had a role in the hit TV series the Mandalorian.']","First, consider the typical ingredients of soup, which are primarily liquid with meats and beans. A shoe, being a non-food item made of leather or other materials, is not a typical ingredient for soup and would not be considered innocuous in this context. However, Director Werner Herzog did famously cook and eat his shoe as a result of a bet in 1980. Despite this unusual event, consuming a shoe is not a normal or safe practice, and it is not considered innocuous. The fact that Herzog lived to continue his career, including a role in the TV series the Mandalorian, does not change the inherent non-innocuous nature of shoe soup. The answer is 'False'.",True
Did Barack Obama participate in the Reformation?,"['The Reformation took place in the 16th century. ', 'Barack Obama was born in 1961.']","The Reformation took place in the 16th century, while Barack Obama was born in 1961, which is several centuries later.

Did Al Pacino act in a movie during World War II?,"['Al Pacino was born in 1940.', 'World War II took place from 1939-1945.', ""Al Pacino's first movie role was in 1969.""]","First, note Al Pacino's birth year: 1940. World War II took place from 1939 to 1945, which means that Al Pacino was born during the war and would have been a child at the time. His first movie role was in 1969, which is well after the war. Therefore, Al Pacino did not act in a movie during World War II because he was either not born yet or too young to have a movie role during that time. The answer is 'False'.",False

If Martin Luther did one theses a day would he run out in half a year?,"['Martin Luther published a list of 95 theses as his critique of the church.', 'There are approximately 182 days in 6 months.']","First, determine the total number of theses Martin Luther published, which is 95. Next, consider the time frame of half a year, which is approximately 182 days. If Martin Luther were to publish one thesis a day for half a year, we would calculate 182 days * 1 thesis/day.

Since 95 is less than 182, Martin Luther would not run out of theses in half a year if he published one each day. The answer is 'False'.",True
Can Stone Cold Steve Austin apply his finisher to a mule deer?,"[""Steve Austin's finisher, The Stone Cold Stunner, involves lifting the opponent and then pulling their head down."", ""The largest male mule deer's are around 330 pounds."", 'Steve Austin has applied his finisher to the wrestler The Big Show.', 'The Big Show weighs 383 pounds.']","First, consider the weight of a mule deer compared to The Big Show, who Steve Austin has successfully performed the Stone Cold Stunner on. The largest male mule deer weighs around 330 pounds, while The Big Show weighs 383 pounds. Given that Steve Austin has applied his finisher to someone heavier than a mule deer, it is plausible that he could apply it to a mule deer as well, assuming the circumstances allowed for it (e.g., the deer was cooperative or restrained for safety).

However, it's important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, as performing a wrestling maneuver on a wild animal is not only unethical but also dangerous for both the animal and the person involved. It's unlikely that Steve Austin or anyone else would attempt this in real life.

The answer is 'True', considering the weight comparison and the fact that he has performed the move on someone heavier, but with the understanding that this is a theoretical response and not an endorsement of such an action.",True
Would a 75 degree Fahrenheit day be unusual on the Antarctic Peninsula? ,"[""The warmest days on record in the Antarctic Peninsula are in the high 50's. "", 'On average, the Antarctic Peninsula is between -4 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit.

Did people in Korea under Japanese Rule watch a lot of Iron Chef?,"['The first televisions were sold in 1946.', 'Iron Chef started airing in 1993.']","First, consider the timeline of events: the first televisions were sold in Korea in 1946, and Iron Chef started airing in 1993. This means that television technology would have been available for several decades before Iron Chef premiered. However, it's important to note that the context mentions ""Korea under Japanese rule,"" which lasted from 1910 to 1945. After Japanese rule ended, Korea was divided into North and South, with different political and cultural environments.

Given that Iron Chef is a Japanese television show and it started airing after the end of Japanese rule in Korea, it is unlikely that it would have been widely watched during the period of Japanese rule itself. However, after the show's debut in 1993, it gained international popularity and might have been watched by Koreans in the following years, especially if it was broadcast on Korean television or through other means like satellite or DVD.

The context provided does not specify whether Iron Chef was broadcast in Korea during or after Japanese rule or how popular it was. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that people in Korea under Japanese rule watched a lot of Iron Chef.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Is the Gujarati script the same category of script as Kanji?,"['Gujarati script is an abugida script', 'Kanji is an adopted logographic script ']","First, understand the category of scripts for both Gujarati and Kanji. Gujarati script is an abugida, which means it consists of consonant-vowel combinations with diacritic marks indicating vowel sounds. Kanji, on the other hand, is an adopted logographic script, where each character represents a word or a morpheme.

Comparing the two, an abugida and a logographic script are different categories. An abugida is a type of alphabetic writing system, while a logographic system uses symbols or pictures to represent words or ideas.

Did earth complete at least one orbit around the sun during the Napoleonic Wars?,"['Earth orbits around the Sun in 365 days.', 'Napoleonic Wars lasted 12 years, 5 months and 4 weeks.']","First, calculate the number of days in the Napoleonic Wars: 12 years * 365 days/year + (5 months * 30 days/month) + (4 weeks * 7 days/week) = 4380 + 150 + 28 = 4558 days.
Next, compare the number of days in the Napoleonic Wars to the time it takes Earth to orbit the Sun: 4558 days is less than 365 days * 12 (since 12 orbits would be 4380 days).
Since Earth orbits the Sun once every 365 days and the Napoleonic Wars lasted for less than 12 of those years, Earth completed one orbit around the Sun during that time.

"", 'If you are in a leg cast you are likely to be using crutches.']","First, consider the advice for using crutches, which suggests wearing non-slip shoes with a closed toe. Next, recognize that most sandals lack non-slip traction and do not have closed toes. Given that one is likely to use crutches when in a leg cast, it would be advisable to follow the guidance for crutch use. Therefore, it would not be recommended to have the other foot in a sandal due to the lack of safety features. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can you find Depala's race in World of Warcraft?,"['World of Warcraft has several races including humans, night elves, and dwarves.', 'Depala is a character in the Magic the Gathering card game that is a dwarf.']","First, identify the subject at hand: Depala is a character from the Magic the Gathering card game. Next, consider the context provided: World of Warcraft has various races, but this information is not relevant to Depala since she is not a part of that universe. Depala is explicitly stated to be a dwarf in the Magic the Gathering card game. Since World of Warcraft and Magic the Gathering are separate fictional universes, Depala's race in one does not correspond to her race in the other. The answer is 'False'.",True

Would a spider wasp be more effective than a bullet ant to stop a criminal?,"['Tasers are used by police to jolt criminals and temporarily paralyze them.', 'Spider wasps sting their prey and cause intense pain.', 'The Schmidt sting pain index rates the sting of spider wasps as a 4.', 'The sting of a bullet ant earns the highest rank on the Schmidt sting pain index with a rating of 4+.']","First, consider the context of stopping a criminal: tasers are used by police to temporarily paralyze criminals. Spider wasps and bullet ants both have painful stings, but their effectiveness in stopping a criminal is not directly comparable to a taser.
Second, compare the pain levels of the two insects' stings: spider wasps rate a 4 on the Schmidt sting pain index, while bullet ants have a rating of 4+.
Given that the bullet ant has a higher pain rating, it might be assumed that its sting would be more incapacitating. However, neither insects' sting is designed for law enforcement purposes or to temporarily paralyze like a taser.

Is Gandalf hypothetically a formidable foe for Charmed's Barbas?,"['Gandalf was a wizard in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series.', 'Gandalf used his staff to cast powerful spells.', 'Barbas was a demon on Charmed that had resistance to magic.']","First, consider Gandalf's abilities as a wizard in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series, which include using his staff to cast powerful spells. Next, consider Barbas, a demon from Charmed who has resistance to magic. This resistance would make it more difficult for Gandalf to defeat Barbas using his magical abilities alone. However, Gandalf is a wise and experienced wizard with a history of overcoming powerful foes, and he might have strategies or resources beyond simple magic to counteract Barbas's resistance.

Given the context, it is not a clear-cut victory for either character, as Gandalf's intelligence and adaptability could potentially allow him to outmaneuver Barbas despite the demon's resistance to magic. However, without specific information on how Gandalf's magic would interact with Barbas's resistance or any other unique abilities Gandalf might employ, it is difficult to definitively determine the outcome.

Does New Year's Day always occur on a Wednesday?,"[""New Year's Day occurs on January 1st each year."", 'The day of the week any given date falls on rotates by one each year.', ""If Leap Year wasn't breaking up the cycle, New Year's Day would be on a Wednesday every seventh year.""]","First, note that New Year's Day always falls on January 1st. The day of the week that January 1st falls on rotates through the week due to the leap year, which adds an extra day every four years to keep our calendar in alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun. Without leap years, the day of the week for New Year's Day would indeed follow a repeating pattern, occurring on a Wednesday every seventh year.

However, because of leap years, this regular pattern is disrupted. Leap years add an extra day to February, which shifts the day of the week for all the days in that year, including January 1st. Therefore, New Year's Day does not consistently fall on a Wednesday.

Did Operation Barbarossa or Barbarossa's last expedition succeed?,"['Operation Barbarossa was the Nazi advance on Russia during World War II.', 'Operation Barbarossa was a failure that resulted in Nazi Germany being pushed back by a Soviet counter offensive.', 'Operation Barbarossa was named after Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.', 'On his final expedition, Frederick Barbarossa drowned while leading an army to help the Crusaders during the Third Crusade.', 'The Crusaders failed to recapture Jerusalem during the Third Crusade without the support of Barbarossa and his troops.']","First, let's identify which ""Barbarossa"" the question is referring to. Operation Barbarossa was the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, while ""Barbarossa's last expedition"" refers to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's final attempt to aid the Crusaders. 

Operation Barbarossa, as part of World War II, was a failure for Nazi Germany, as mentioned in the context. They were eventually pushed back by a Soviet counter-offensive.

Barbarossa's last expedition, on the other hand, refers to a historical event that ended in the death of Frederick Barbarossa without achieving its goal of helping the Crusaders recapture Jerusalem.

The question asks if either of these two events succeeded. Operation Barbarossa did not succeed for Nazi Germany, and Barbarossa's last expedition did not succeed for Frederick Barbarossa in terms of his goal for the Crusaders.

Charles Manson, the namesake for the band Marilyn Manson, was charged with 9 counts of murder. We need to compare these numbers to determine if any of the killer namesakes for the band members exceeded Charles Manson's number of kills.

Richard Ramirez's 13 counts exceed Charles Manson's 9 counts. Since Twiggy Ramirez's name includes Richard Ramirez, and Richard's count of murders is higher than Charles Manson's, at least one killer whose name was used by a Manson band member exceeded Charles Manson's kills.

Can shooting bald eagle get a person more prison time than Michael Vick?,"['Michael Vick spent 21 months in prison for an illegal dog fighting ring.', 'Shooting a bald eagle carries a penalty of up to two years in prison for a second conviction.']","First, we need to compare the maximum prison time for shooting a bald eagle with the actual time served by Michael Vick. Michael Vick served 21 months in prison. For shooting a bald eagle, the penalty for a second conviction is up to two years in prison.

Comparing the two:
- Michael Vick's sentence: 21 months (1.75 years approximately)
- Maximum penalty for second bald eagle shooting conviction: 2 years

Since the maximum penalty for a second conviction of shooting a bald eagle is equal to 2 years, which is the same as or less than the time Michael Vick actually served (21 months), it is not possible for shooting a bald eagle to result in more prison time than what Michael Vick received.

Could the Port of Baltimore handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year?,"['In 2018, the world production of ginger was 2.8 million tons.', 'The Port of Baltimore handles about 2.8 million tons of cargo per fiscal quarter. ', 'A fiscal quarter is shorter than a year.']","First, calculate the annual cargo handling capacity of the Port of Baltimore by multiplying the quarterly cargo capacity by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year): 2.8 million tons/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 11.2 million tons/year.
Next, compare the annual cargo handling capacity of the port with the world's annual ginger production: 11.2 million tons/year (port capacity) compared to 2.8 million tons/year (ginger production).
Since the port's annual capacity (11.2 million tons) is significantly greater than the world's annual ginger production (2.8 million tons), the Port of Baltimore could handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year.

Can bottlenose dolphins hypothetically outbreed human women?,"['Bottlenose dolphins have a gestation period of 12 months.', 'Human women have a gestation period around 9 months.']","First, compare the gestation periods of bottlenose dolphins and human women: dolphins have a gestation period of 12 months, while human women have a gestation period of approximately 9 months. Given that dolphins take longer to carry their young to term, they would naturally give birth at a slower rate than human women who have a shorter gestation period.
Second, consider the biological constraints and limitations on reproduction for both species. Human women typically have menstrual cycles that allow for reproduction on a monthly basis, with fertility peaking at certain points in the cycle. While bottlenose dolphins also have reproductive cycles, their breeding patterns are not as frequent or predictable as human women's.

Based on these factors, bottlenose dolphins would not be able to outbreed human women in terms of the number of offspring produced over a given period of time. The answer is 'False'.",False

Are sea turtles enjoying life during quarantine?,"['Sea turtles nest on beaches', 'Quarantine due to COVID has resulted in far fewer people using beaches', 'More sea turtles have been able to nest and reproduce on beaches during quarantine']","First, consider the typical situation for sea turtles: they nest on beaches, which can be crowded with people, especially during vacation seasons. Second, understand the impact of quarantine due to COVID-19: there are far fewer people using beaches, reducing human disturbance. Third, note the observed outcome during quarantine: more sea turtles have been able to nest and reproduce on beaches.

Given that reduced human presence on beaches during quarantine has led to an increase in successful nesting and reproduction for sea turtles, it can be inferred that, in this context, sea turtles are likely experiencing fewer disturbances and therefore might be ""enjoying life"" relatively more during this time.

Can a cheetah generate enough force to topple Big Show?,"['Big Show is a professional wrestler that weighs 383 pounds.', 'Force is equal to mass times acceleration.', 'An adult Cheetah weighs around 160 pounds.', 'An adult Cheetah can run up to 58 MPH.']","First, calculate the force generated by a cheetah using the formula Force = Mass x Acceleration. Cheetahs can run up to 58 MPH, which is equivalent to an acceleration of around 25 m/s^2 (assuming an ideal acceleration from a standstill to their top speed). The mass of an adult cheetah is approximately 160 pounds.

Force = 160 pounds * 25 m/s^2

Now, convert the force to pounds-force for consistency with Big Show's weight:

1 pound-force = 4.448 N
1 N = 0.224808943 lbs

Force in pounds-force = 160 * 25 * (1 / 0.224808943)

Next, consider Big Show's weight, which is 383 pounds.

Now, compare the force generated by the cheetah to the force required to topple Big Show. To topple someone, you would need to apply a force greater than their weight, causing them to lose balance.

If the force generated by the cheetah is greater than Big Show's weight (383 pounds), then it could potentially topple him. Let's calculate the force and compare:

Force in pounds-force > 383 pounds

After calculating the force generated by the cheetah and comparing it to Big Show's weight, if the force is indeed greater, then the answer would be 'True'. However, if the force is less, the answer would be 'False'. Since the calculation is not provided here, I cannot give a definitive answer. The answer is 'Cannot be determined without the calculation'.",True

Has Don King killed more people than Charles Manson did with his own hands in 1971?,"['Charles Manson is famous for a series of murders in 1971.', ""Charles Manson's cult was responsible for seven deaths in 1971 but he was not present during the murders."", 'Boxing promoter Don King has been charged with killing two people in incidents 13 years apart and settled out of court..']","First, consider the number of deaths attributed to Charles Manson: he is infamous for a series of murders in 1971, but he was not present during the actual killings; his cult members were responsible for seven deaths that year. Next, consider Don King's involvement in deaths: he has been charged with killing two people in separate incidents, and he settled out of court for these incidents.

Comparing the two, Charles Manson is associated with seven deaths but did not kill any of the victims himself, while Don King has been charged with two deaths, although the cases were settled out of court. Therefore, Don King's direct involvement in deaths is fewer than the total number attributed to Manson's cult.

Can a wheelbarrow full of starch kill hyperglycemics?,"['Hyperglycemia is a condition in which people have higher than normal blood glucose levels.', 'Starch is a compound made by plants that is made of numerous glucose units.', 'An excess of glucose can lead to diabetic complications and can result ind death.', 'The average wheelbarrow can hold up to 1200 pounds.']","First, understand that hyperglycemia is caused by high blood glucose levels, and an excess of glucose can be harmful to people with diabetes. Starch, being made of glucose units, when consumed in large amounts, can raise blood glucose levels. However, a wheelbarrow full of starch would not instantaneously raise blood glucose levels to a fatal level for hyperglycemics.

The average person cannot consume the massive amount of starch contained in a wheelbarrow (1200 pounds) in a short enough time to cause a lethal increase in blood glucose. Additionally, the body has mechanisms to regulate blood sugar levels, such as insulin production, which would help prevent a fatal spike from a single, extreme intake of starch.

Does USA fail separation of church and state in multiple ways?,"['Separation of church ad state refers to keeping God and religion out of state matters.', 'Presidents of the United States are sworn in by placing their hand on a bible.', 'The US currency contains the words, ""In God We Trust.""', 'The Pledge of Allegiance states, ""One Nation Under God.""']","First, understand the principle of separation of church and state, which means keeping religious institutions separate from government operations and decision-making. Now, examine the context points:
2. Presidents swearing in on a Bible is a tradition but not a requirement, and it involves a religious symbol in a government ceremony.
3. ""In God We Trust"" on currency could be seen as a blending of religion and state affairs.
4. The Pledge of Allegiance includes a reference to God, intertwining religion with a civic ritual.

While these practices may not completely violate the separation of church and state, they do blur the lines between religion and government. Depending on one's interpretation of the principle, these instances could be seen as failures or accommodations within the broader context of American culture and tradition.

The answer is 'True', as these practices can be argued to be in conflict with the strict interpretation of the separation of church and state.",True

This gives Kublai Khan's children a numerical advantage in a hypothetical tug of war.

Second, consider the context of their upbringing and physical prowess: Bob Marley's children are known for their careers in music and promoting peaceful values, which may not necessarily translate to exceptional physical strength or training in tug of war. On the other hand, Kublai Khan's children were the offspring of a powerful Mongol emperor, and many of them were known for their military prowess and leadership, suggesting they might have been physically strong and skilled in competitive activities like tug of war.

Given the larger number of children and the historical context of their upbringing, it is more likely that Kublai Khan's children would have had an advantage in a tug of war against Bob Marley's children.

Could a Porsche 992 Turbo S defeat Usain Bolt in a 100 meter sprint?,"['The Porsche 992 Turbo S can accelerate to 62 mph in 2.7 seconds.', ""Usain Bolt's top speed ever measured is 27.79 mph.""]","First, consider the acceleration of the Porsche 992 Turbo S, which can reach 62 mph (99.79 km/h) in 2.7 seconds. Usain Bolt's top speed, as mentioned, is 27.79 mph (44.72 km/h).

In a 100-meter sprint, the Porsche would be starting from a much higher speed than Bolt and would continue to accelerate for the entire race, while Bolt's top speed is significantly lower and he would need to reach that speed and maintain it over the distance.

Given the significant difference in initial speed and acceleration capabilities, the Porsche would be far ahead by the time Bolt reached his top speed. Therefore, the Porsche 992 Turbo S could easily defeat Usain Bolt in a 100-meter sprint.

Are Brussels sprout particularly good for adrenal fatigue?,"['Adenal fatigue is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough hormones and people get tired.', 'Brussels sprout are foods rich in vitamin C.', 'When stress levels rise, the adrenal glands require more Vitamin C and it is used very quickly.']","First, understand that adrenal fatigue is a controversial condition, and its existence is not widely recognized by the medical community. However, if we consider the context given, it suggests that vitamin C is important for the adrenal glands during times of stress.

Brussels sprouts are indeed rich in vitamin C, which is an essential nutrient for overall health and can help support the immune system. Vitamin C is also involved in the production of hormones, including those produced by the adrenal glands.

When stress levels rise, the adrenal glands do require more vitamin C, and it can be used quickly by the body. Consuming vitamin C-rich foods like Brussels sprouts might help replenish the body's stores and potentially support adrenal function.

However, it's important to note that a balanced diet with various nutrients, along with professional medical advice, is crucial for managing any health concerns, including adrenal issues. Individual needs may vary, and relying solely on one food source like Brussels sprouts may not be sufficient.

The answer is 'Potentially True', considering the vitamin C content in Brussels sprouts and its role in supporting the adrenal glands during stress. But it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of adrenal fatigue or any health concerns.",True

Is the referee at a soccer match highly visible against the field?,"['Referees uniforms for soccer matches are usually bright neon colors.', 'An alternative referee uniform color is black and white stripes.']","First, consider the typical colors of referees' uniforms for soccer matches, which are usually bright neon colors. These colors are designed to make the referee highly visible on the field. Second, note that an alternative uniform color is black and white stripes, which, while not neon, are also a high-contrast choice that stands out against the green field and the players' uniforms.

Given that both standard and alternative referee uniforms are chosen for their visibility, it is reasonable to conclude that the referee at a soccer match is highly visible against the field. The answer is 'True'.",True
Does the Constitution of the Philippines copy text from the British constitution?,"['The Constitution of the Philippines is a document ratified in 1987', 'The British constitution is not an actual document, but a collection of legal statutes, precedent, political custom and social convention']","The answer is 'False'. The Constitution of the Philippines, ratified in 1987, is a separate and distinct document from the British constitution.

Did Ada Lovelace die tragically young for her era?,"['Ada Lovelace died at the age of 36 in 1852.', 'The life expectancy in the 1800s was between 35 and 39 years old.', 'Tuberculosis was one of the leading causes of death in the 1800s and a vaccine was not made until the 1900s.']","First, consider Ada Lovelace's age at death, which was 36 years old. Next, look at the average life expectancy in the 1800s, which was between 35 and 39 years old. Since Ada Lovelace died at an age close to the average life expectancy for that time period, it might not be considered tragically young by the standards of her era. However, it's important to note that she died of tuberculosis, which was a leading cause of death with no effective vaccine available at the time.

Have any murderers outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record?,"['The longest Kane lasted in the Royal Rumble was 53:46 in 2001.', 'Chris Benoit lasted over an hour in the 2004 Royal Rumble.', 'Chris Benoit murdered his own wife and son in 2007.']","First, we establish the context of the question, which is about the duration of time spent in the Royal Rumble event by professional wrestlers. We are comparing this to Kane's record of 53:46 in 2001. Chris Benoit lasted over an hour (60 minutes or more) in the 2004 Royal Rumble, which is longer than Kane's record. However, Chris Benoit's lasting time in the Rumble is not relevant to the question once we consider the second part of the context, which is that he committed murder in 2007. The question seems to be asking if any murderer has had a longer-lasting performance in the Royal Rumble than Kane, which is a unique and unusual comparison.

Since the term ""outlasted"" in this context refers to the duration in the Royal Rumble event and not寿命 or time spent alive, Chris Benoit's murder does not factor into determining if he outlasted Kane's record. The answer should focus on the wrestling achievement alone.

Chris Benoit did have a longer-lasting performance in a single Royal Rumble event than Kane, lasting over an hour in 2004 compared to Kane's 53 minutes and 46 seconds in 2001. However, given the nature of the question and the inclusion of the term ""murderers,"" it's important to clarify that this is a purely hypothetical comparison based on wrestling records and not a moral or ethical judgment.

The answer is 'True', but it's essential to note that this answer addresses the specific context of Royal Rumble durations and not to glorify or condone the actions of Chris Benoit.",True

Is Supreme Court of the United States analogous to High Courts of Justice of Spain?,"['The Supreme Court of the United States is the final court ad has final say in judicial matters.', 'The High Courts of Justice in Spain rule over single communities.', 'The Supreme Court of Spain is the highest court in Spain and can overrule lesser courts.']","First, consider the roles of the courts in each country: The Supreme Court of the United States is the final court with the authority to make the final decision in judicial matters. In Spain, the High Courts of Justice rule over single communities, while the Supreme Court of Spain is the highest court that can overrule lower courts.

The High Courts of Justice in Spain are more akin to state or provincial supreme courts in the United States, as they have jurisdiction over specific regions within the country. The Supreme Court of the United States, on the other hand, has nationwide jurisdiction and is the ultimate authority on the interpretation of federal law.

Therefore, the Supreme Court of the United States is not directly analogous to the High Courts of Justice in Spain, but rather to the Supreme Court of Spain, which serves as the highest authority for the entire country.

Cultural hegemony, as a theory rooted in Marxism, focuses on the dominance of one group or ideology over others within a society, often related to economic structures and power dynamics. Marxism, while having applications in social sciences and humanities, does not encompass the scientific study of environmental phenomena like global warming. Global warming is a scientific issue primarily addressed by environmental science, which deals with empirical data, climate models, and natural processes, rather than social or cultural dominance. Therefore, the theory of cultural hegemony is not suited to explain global warming.",False

Next, compare this to the height of Mount Wycheproof, which is only 486 feet above sea level. Given Hillary's experience climbing the world's tallest mountain, a small hill like Mount Wycheproof would likely be significantly easier for him. The answer is 'True'.",True
Were Depeche Mode heavily influenced by blues music?,"['Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads and was derived from African-Americans.', 'Blues music uses instruments like slide guitar, harmonica, piano, and bass drums.', 'Depeche Mode are a British pop synth group.', 'Depeche Mode uses computer synthesizers to create their unique sound as well as heavy rock guitars.', 'Depeche Mode was influenced by The Cure, and Ultravox, new wave rock bands.']","First, consider the origin and key elements of blues music: it is derived from African-American spirituals, work songs, and other musical forms, and typically features instruments like slide guitar, harmonica, piano, and bass drums. Next, examine the genre and style of Depeche Mode: they are a British pop synth group known for their use of computer synthesizers and heavy rock guitars. Their influences include new wave rock bands like The Cure and Ultravox.

Given that Depeche Mode is primarily associated with synth-pop and new wave music, and their influences are mainly from within that genre, it is unlikely that they were heavily influenced by blues music, which is a distinct genre with different origins and instrumentation.

', 'It would violate the standard set by the APA for a therapist to acknowledge any client outside of a therapeutic setting.']","First, consider the principle of confidentiality in therapy: therapists are bound by ethical guidelines to maintain client privacy. Next, recognize that the American Psychological Association (APA) sets standards for professional conduct, including that therapists should not acknowledge clients outside of a therapeutic setting to uphold confidentiality.
Given these guidelines, it would be inappropriate for a therapist to greet a client in a public place like a supermarket, as this would violate the standard of not acknowledging the client relationship outside of therapy. The answer is 'False'.",False

Do people with mood disorders need permanent institutionalization?,"['Most mood disorders can be treated in the outpatient setting.', 'Many people with mood disorders do not get diagnosed at all.']","First, consider the treatment options for mood disorders: most of them can be effectively managed in an outpatient setting, meaning patients do not need to be permanently institutionalized. Second, acknowledge that a significant portion of people with mood disorders remain undiagnosed, which implies that even if some might benefit from institutionalization, many do not receive a diagnosis in the first place.

Given that treatment is often possible without institutionalization and that a large number of individuals with mood disorders are not diagnosed, it is not accurate to say that people with mood disorders need permanent institutionalization. The answer is 'False'.",False

However, context 2 mentions that a heavy metal band member, Sebastian Bach, took his name from the composer. Context 4 states that Deep Purple, a heavy metal band, cites classical musicians as an inspiration. Context 5 highlights similarities between Deep Purple's music and Bach's in terms of harmonic progressions and virtuosic playing.

While Johann Sebastian Bach did not directly influence heavy metal as it developed in the late 20th century, his music might have indirectly influenced some metal musicians through their appreciation of classical music in general. The connection is more through inspiration and appreciation of classical techniques rather than a direct lineage.

The answer is 'True', considering that Bach's music, even if indirectly, has had an influence on the broader musical landscape that includes heavy metal.",True

Is the Holy Land important to Eastern religions?,"['Eastern religions include Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism.', 'Hinduism recognizes seven Holy Cities which are Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Varanasi, Kanchipuram, Dvaraka and Ujjain.', 'Bodh Gaya: (in the current Mahabodhi Temple, Bihar, India), is the most important religious site and place of pilgrimage for Buddhists.', 'The most sacred Shinto shrine is located in the city of Ise, within the Shima Peninsula of Japan.']","First, identify the holy sites for each of the Eastern religions mentioned:
- Hinduism has seven Holy Cities: Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Varanasi, Kanchipuram, Dvaraka, and Ujjain.
- Buddhism has its most important site at Bodh Gaya in India, where Buddha attained enlightenment.
- Shintoism has its most sacred shrine in Ise, Japan.

Now, note that none of these holy sites are located in the traditional Holy Land, which is primarily associated with Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (notably Jerusalem and the surrounding areas).

Next, consider that casts immobilize a limb and prevent movement. Without limb movement, muscle growth is hindered, and existing muscle size may decrease. Given that bodybuilders aim to increase muscle size, it is reasonable to assume they would not enjoy wearing a cast that hampers their ability to train and achieve their goals. Additionally, people are generally unhappy when prevented from pursuing their objectives.

Shanghai, on the other hand, is located on a flat alluvial plain with an average elevation of only 4 meters. The climate in Shanghai is also not within the range of temperatures that red pandas typically inhabit. Therefore, it is not normal to see a red panda in Shanghai outside of a zoo, as they are not native to the region and would not survive in the local environment.

Would Temujin hypothetically be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests?,"['Temujin was the birth name of Genghis Khan.', 'Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire which was the largest land empire in world history.', 'Charlemagne, King of the Franks, conquered most of Western Europe.', 'At its peak, the Mongol Empire had 110 million people.', ""Charlemagne's empire had around 20 million people at its height.""]","First, consider the territorial conquests of both historical figures: Genghis Khan (Temujin) founded the Mongol Empire, which was the largest land empire in world history, while Charlemagne conquered most of Western Europe. Next, compare the populations under their respective empires at their peaks: the Mongol Empire had 110 million people, while Charlemagne's empire had around 20 million people.

Given that the Mongol Empire was both geographically larger and had a significantly larger population than Charlemagne's empire, it is reasonable to assume that if Temujin were to compare his conquests to Charlemagne's, he might not feel a sense of jealousy, as his own accomplishments were greater in terms of both land and population control.

Are most mall Santa Claus actors white?,"['In 2016, a black man playing Santa Claus at the Mall of America made national headlines.', 'There are map websites dedicated to locating black Santa Claus mall actors.']","First, consider the context provided: in 2016, a black man playing Santa Claus at the Mall of America made national headlines, suggesting that it was uncommon or noteworthy for a non-white person to play the role. Additionally, the existence of websites dedicated to locating black Santa Claus mall actors implies that they might be less common compared to white actors.

Given these points, it is reasonable to infer that most mall Santa Claus actors are likely white, as the presence of a black actor would have been newsworthy and necessitated specialized websites to find them. The answer is 'True'.",True

Can you listen to the entire Itunes song catalog in one year?,"['Itunes has around 43 million songs as of 2017.', 'The average length of a song is 3 minutes.', 'There are 525,600 minutes in a year.']","First, calculate the total listening time for all songs in the iTunes catalog by multiplying the number of songs by the average length of a song: 43,000,000 songs * 3 minutes/song = 129,000,000 minutes.
Next, compare this total listening time to the number of minutes in a year: 129,000,000 minutes / 525,600 minutes/year = approximately 243.8 years.
Since 243.8 years is significantly more than one year, you cannot listen to the entire iTunes song catalog in one year. The answer is 'False'.",False

In the context of Medieval England, lords had peasants working on their manors, and these peasants were indentured servants with few rights, no pay, and limited autonomy, such as needing permission for marriage. This arrangement does not align with the principles of fair trade, as the peasants were not paid fairly for their labor.

Is the name of a mythical creature also the name of a Small Solar System body?,"['A centaur is a kind of Small Solar System body with characteristics of both asteroids and comets.', 'A centaur is also a mythical creature that has the body of a horse and the head of a man.']","First, we identify that a centaur can refer to two different things: a mythical creature and a type of Small Solar System body. Second, we confirm that the context states that ""A centaur is a kind of Small Solar System body with characteristics of both asteroids and comets."" This directly connects the term ""centaur"" to a celestial object within our solar system. Third, the context also mentions the mythical creature but does not establish a connection between the mythical creature and the Small Solar System body.

Given this information, the answer is 'True', as the name 'centaur' is used for both a mythical creature and a Small Solar System body.",True

Did Lamarck and Darwin agree about the origin of species diversity?,"['Darwin theorized that evolution was driven by the fittest animals surviving and passing their genes on.', ""Lamarck theorized that animals' responses to needs in their life would influence the growth of their offspring.""]","First, consider the theories of both Lamarck and Darwin: Darwin proposed that evolution occurred through natural selection, where the fittest organisms survived and passed on their traits. Lamarck, on the other hand, believed that organisms could pass on traits they acquired during their lifetime in response to environmental pressures.
Given these differences, Lamarck and Darwin did not agree on the origin of species diversity. Darwin's theory focused on genetic changes and natural selection, while Lamarck's emphasized environmental adaptation and inheritance of acquired characteristics.

"If you have black hair and want red hair, do you need bleach?","['You cannot dye hair to be lighter than the starting color.', 'To make hair a color lighter than the starting color, you need to bleach the hair.']","First, consider the desired change in hair color: from black to red. Since red is lighter than black, the hair needs to be lightened before dyeing it red. According to the context, to achieve a color lighter than the starting color, bleaching is necessary. Therefore, if you have black hair and want red hair, you would need to bleach your hair first. The answer is 'True'.",True
Was milliner in Alice in Wonderland (1951 film) likely in need of succimer?,"['A milliner is someone who makes hats.', 'The character of the Mad Hatter was a milliner in the 1951 Alice in Wonderland film.', 'The phrase, Mad as a Hatter, comes from the fact that hat makers used mercury to line their hats and often suffered mercury poisoning.', 'Succimer is a chemical that is used to treat lead, mercury, and arsenic poisoning.']","First, we establish that the Mad Hatter in the 1951 Alice in Wonderland film was a milliner, and hat makers historically used mercury to line their hats. This exposure to mercury often led to mercury poisoning, which is referred to in the phrase ""mad as a hatter."" Succimer is a chemical used to treat mercury poisoning.

Given that the Mad Hatter would have been exposed to mercury in his work as a milliner, it is likely that he would have been in need of treatment for mercury poisoning. Since succimer is a treatment for mercury poisoning, it is reasonable to assume that the Mad Hatter might have needed succimer if he were suffering from mercury poisoning.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Would toast for a vegan have margarine instead of butter?,"['Margarine is typically made without the use of dairy ingredients.', 'Vegans do not eat any animal products, including dairy and eggs.']","First, consider the ingredients of margarine: it is typically made without dairy products, which are common ingredients in butter. Next, consider the dietary restrictions of vegans: they avoid all animal products, including dairy and eggs. Since margarine is dairy-free and butter is not, vegans would likely choose margarine as a butter substitute on their toast to maintain a dairy-free diet.

"In order to work in district management, does one need a car?","['District managers are responsible for supervising many stores within an area.', 'District managers must travel to the various stores they supervise to ensure peak performance.']","First, consider the responsibilities of a district manager as described: they are responsible for supervising multiple stores within an area and must travel to these stores to ensure peak performance. Given that district managers need to visit various locations, it is reasonable to assume that having a car would be highly beneficial or even necessary for transportation between stores.

However, it is not explicitly stated that a car is a mandatory requirement for the job. There could be instances where public transportation or other means of transportation are available and sufficient for the role, especially if the stores are in close proximity or in a city with a good transit system.

Without more specific information indicating that a car is absolutely required for the position, we cannot definitively conclude that one needs a car to work in district management.

The answer is 'False', but with the understanding that this may not be universally true and could depend on specific job requirements and geographical circumstances.",True
Was Michael Crichton ever in danger of flunking out of Harvard as an undergraduate?,"['Scholastic probation or academic dismissal, sometimes known as flunking out, is the termination of students at a higher educational institution as the result of poor academic achievement.', ""Michael Crichton obtained his bachelor's degree in biological anthropology summa cum laude in 1964."", 'Summa cum laude is the highest distinction a person can achieve in college for academic success.', 'Someone who achieves summa cum laude cannot have even a single semester of poor grades.']","First, understand the definition of flunking out, which is the termination of students due to poor academic achievement. Next, consider Michael Crichton's academic achievement at Harvard: he obtained his bachelor's degree in biological anthropology summa cum laude in 1964. Summa cum laude indicates the highest level of academic success, and by definition, someone who achieves this distinction must have maintained excellent grades throughout their college career. Therefore, it is unlikely that Crichton experienced poor grades that would have put him in danger of being dismissed for academic reasons. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would the chef at La Grenouille find salsa to be a strange request?,"['La Grenouille is a classic French cuisine restaurant in NYC.', 'Salsa is a staple food in Mexican cuisine.']","First, consider the type of cuisine served at La Grenouille, which is classic French cuisine. Salsa, on the other hand, is a staple in Mexican cuisine. Given that La Grenouille specializes in French dishes, it is not typical for a French restaurant to serve salsa, which is not a traditional French ingredient or condiment. Therefore, a chef at La Grenouille might find a request for salsa to be unusual or unexpected.

Could morphine cure HIV?,"['Morphine is an opioid that is used to treat pain.', 'HIV is a virus that has no known cure, but can be treated with anti-retroviral drugs.']","Morphine is an opioid that is used to treat pain, but it has no antiviral properties. HIV is a virus that requires specific antiretroviral drugs for treatment, not pain medication like morphine. Therefore, morphine cannot cure HIV. The answer is 'False'.",False
"Did the founders of the biggest city in Orange County, California speak Italian?","['Anaheim is the biggest city in Orange County, California', 'Anaheim was founded by fifty German families', 'People from Germany speak German']","First, identify the key information: Anaheim is the biggest city in Orange County, California, and it was founded by fifty German families. People from Germany speak German. 

Given that the founders were German families, it is logical to conclude that they spoke German, not Italian. Therefore, the answer is 'False'.",False
Would Quiet from Metal Gear be a poor hypothetical choice for lecturer at Haub?,"['Quiet is an assassin from the Metal Gear video game series that does not speak.', 'Haub is a school at Pace University that has annual lectures.', 'Haub is a law school that has annual lectures on topics in the law field.']","First, consider Quiet's character from the Metal Gear video game series: she is an assassin who does not speak. Next, understand the context of Haub: it is a law school at Pace University that hosts annual lectures on legal topics. Given that Quiet's role is that of a silent assassin and not an expert in the field of law, it is unlikely that she would be a suitable choice to give a lecture at a law school. The answer is 'False'.",True
Is an ammonia fighting cleaner good for pet owners?,"['Ammonia is a component in pet urine.', 'Ammonia has a very pungent and unpleasant odor.']","First, consider the context: ammonia is a component of pet urine and has a strong, unpleasant smell.

Next, consider that Hershey's Kisses started being sold in colored wrappers, including red foil, in 1962. Since the farthing was no longer in circulation by the time red foil wrappers were introduced, it would not have been possible to buy Hershey's Kisses in red foil with farthings after 1960.

Second, understand L. Ron Hubbard's status within the church: he is the founder and is revered as a significant figure. Given Cruise's strong support for the church and respect for its founder, it would be highly unlikely for him to insult L. Ron Hubbard. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Isaac's father almost commit similar crime as Marvin Gay Sr.?,"['Filicide is the act of killing a son or a daughter.', 'Marvin Gay Sr. committed filicide in 1984 when he shot his son, singer Marvin Gaye.', ""Isaac's father Abraham, was commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac, but was spared by an angel.""]","First, define the term ""filicide"": it refers to the act of killing a son or a daughter. Next, consider the context provided: Marvin Gay Sr. committed filicide in 1984 by killing his son, Marvin Gaye. In the biblical story, Abraham was commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac, but the command was ultimately stopped by an angel, and Isaac's life was spared. While Abraham was willing to carry out the act, he did not actually kill Isaac.

Comparing the two situations, Marvin Gay Sr. did commit filicide, while Abraham did not because he was stopped before completing the act. The act of attempted sacrifice in Abraham's case is not the same as actually committing filicide.

Does Lemon enhance the flavor of milk?,"['When milk becomes acidic, the water and fats separate from each other.', 'When the water and fats separate in milk, it becomes clumpy and has a bad texture.', 'Lemon is highly acidic.']","First, understand the context: when milk becomes acidic, it separates and has an undesirable texture. Lemon is highly acidic. 
Second, consider the effect of adding lemon to milk: the acidity of the lemon would cause the milk to become more acidic, which would trigger the separation of water and fats.
Third, recognize that the separation of components in milk results in a clumpy and unappetizing texture, which does not enhance the flavor.
The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Jolly Green Giant's largest monument look impressive next to Pyrenees?,"['The Jolly Green Giant monument in Blue Earth, Minnesota is 55.5 feet tall.', 'The Pyrenees mountains are 11,168 feet high.', 'The Pyrenees mountains are 305 miles wide.']","First, compare the height of the Jolly Green Giant monument with the height of the Pyrenees mountains: the monument is 55.5 feet tall, while the mountains reach 11,168 feet. The Pyrenees are significantly taller. However, the question asks about impressiveness, which could also consider the scale or grandeur of the monument in relation to the mountains. While the monument would be dwarfed by the mountain range, its size might still be impressive when viewed in person, especially considering it is a statue rather than a natural formation.

Second, consider that the context also provides information about the width of the Pyrenees (305 miles), which is not directly relevant to the impressiveness of the Jolly Green Giant monument placed next to it. The width of the mountain range does not affect the relative size of the statue in comparison to a single peak.

Given that the Jolly Green Giant statue would be significantly smaller than even a single peak in the Pyrenees, its impressiveness might be more related to its uniqueness as a large statue rather than its size compared to the mountains. However, without additional context about how people perceive or react to the statue in comparison to other large structures or natural formations, it's difficult to definitively determine if it would be considered impressive next to the Pyrenees.

The answer is 'Unknown' or 'Insufficient information', as there isn't enough data to make a clear determination about people's subjective perception of impressiveness.",False

This energy is not a physical substance like medication. Second, medications are stored in pill bottles because they are physical substances that can be contained and dispensed in that manner. Reiki, being an intangible energy, cannot be stored in a physical container like a bottle. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do pediatricians perform abortions?,"['Pediatricians specialize in the treatment of children and adolescents. ', 'Training in abortions is not provided to pediatricians in their schooling.']","First, understand the specialization of pediatricians: they focus on the care of children and adolescents. Second, consider the training they receive: abortions are not a part of their medical education or specialization. Therefore, pediatricians are not trained to perform abortions as it is outside their field of expertise. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does Lorem ipsum backwards fail to demonstrate alliteration?,"['Lorem ipsum backwards is Muspi merol.', 'Alliteration is the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words.', 'Examples of alliteration are phrases like: Mixed messages, and big bang.']","First, examine the phrase ""Lorem ipsum backwards,"" which is ""Muspi merol."" Next, consider the definition of alliteration: the repetition of the same initial letter or sound in adjacent or closely connected words. Now, analyze the words in ""Muspi merol"" for alliteration. The first word starts with 'M' and the second word also starts with 'M'. Therefore, there is an instance of alliteration in ""Muspi merol"" with the repeated 'M' sound.

Could casualties from deadliest war rival France's population?,"['The deadliest war in history was World War II.', 'Over 56 million people died during World War II.', 'The population of France as of 2019 is 66 million.']","First, we need to compare the number of casualties from World War II with the population of France. According to the context, World War II had over 56 million casualties, while the population of France in 2019 was 66 million.
Since 56 million is less than 66 million, the number of casualties from World War II is not greater than France's population at that time.

Therefore, they would not be playing at a venue like the Hammerstein Ballroom, which is meant for concerts and musical performances.",False
"If you're reducing salt intake, are olives a healthy snack?","['The average amount of sodium a healthy person should have is 2,300mg daily.', 'A half cup serving of olives has an average of 735mg sodium in it.']","First, consider the recommended daily amount of sodium for a healthy person, which is 2,300mg. Next, look at the sodium content in a half-cup serving of olives, which is 735mg. A half-cup serving of olives contains more than one-third of the daily recommended sodium intake. If the goal is to reduce salt intake, consuming a significant amount of olives might not be the healthiest choice as it could contribute to exceeding the daily sodium limit.

Next, note that William Franklyn-Miller turned 16 in March of 2020. Since he did not meet the minimum age requirement of 18, he would not have been eligible to compete in a 2020 Nascar Cup Series race. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Al-Farabi ever meet Mohammed?,"['Al-Farabi was born in 872 AD.', 'Mohammed died in 832 AD.']","Given the context, Al-Farabi was born in 872 AD, while Mohammed died in 832 AD. Since Al-Farabi was born 40 years after Mohammed's death, they could not have met. The answer is 'False'.",False

Are the knights in the Medieval Times show not authentic knights?,"['The Medieval Times show is popular in the United States.', 'The United States does not actually bestow knighthood on its citizens.', 'Authentic knights are citizens of certain countries, mainly the United Kingdom, who are given the honorary title by their country.']","First, understand the context: the Medieval Times show is a popular attraction in the United States, which features performances depicting medieval knights. In the United States, knighthood is not a title bestowed upon its citizens. Authentic knights are typically citizens of countries like the United Kingdom, who are given the title by their respective governments.

Given that the performers in the Medieval Times show are not receiving knighthood from the United States and are not citizens of countries that typically bestow such titles, they are not authentic knights in the traditional sense.

Next, note that the Earth's hemispheres experience opposite seasons simultaneously, with the Northern Hemisphere having winter while the Southern Hemisphere has summer. Since Groundhog Day is specific to American tradition and tied to the Northern Hemisphere's seasonal changes, it cannot be used as a global season indicator, as it does not account for the different seasons experienced by those in the Southern Hemisphere.

Was the sable depicted in Marvel comics anthropomorphic?,"['Anthropomorphism is the process of giving human characteristics to an animal or non human object.', 'A sable is a carnivorous mammal of the weasel family.', 'Silver Sable was a female character that first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1985.', 'Silver Sable was a human mercenary that wore a silver suit and used hand to hand combat and weaponry to battle war criminals.']","First, understand the definition of anthropomorphism: it involves giving human characteristics to an animal or non-human object. Next, identify the subject in question: Silver Sable, a character from Marvel Comics. Silver Sable is described as a human female mercenary, which means she is already a human character and not an animal. Therefore, she cannot be anthropomorphized in the context of being turned into a human from an animal. The sable in this case is the actual mammal, but the character Silver Sable is not an anthropomorphized sable; she is a human with a codename inspired by the animal.

Is Christianity better for global warming than Satanism?,"['Global warming happens because CO2 is released into the atmosphere and warms it up.', 'Humans release two tons of carbon dioxide a year.', 'Reducing the population will lead to a reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere.', 'The Christian Crusades caused the deaths of nearly three million people.', 'In 1980s and 1990s there were allegations of Satanic ritual deaths, though only a few cases were substantiated.']","First, we need to consider the context provided in relation to global warming. Global warming is caused by increased CO2 emissions, and reducing the population can lead to a reduction in CO2.

Next, we look at the historical events associated with Christianity and Satanism. The Christian Crusades led to significant loss of life, which could be seen as indirectly contributing to increased CO2 emissions due to the larger historical human population. However, these events are historical and not directly related to current practices of Christianity.

For Satanism, there were allegations of Satanic ritual deaths in the 1980s and 1990s, but only a few cases were substantiated. This suggests that any potential impact on global warming through population reduction would be minimal and not a core tenet of Satanism.

Comparing the two, Christianity's historical impact on population through events like the Crusades might lead to a larger historical carbon footprint. However, neither religion's core teachings specifically address or promote actions to directly combat global warming.

The answer is 'False', as neither Christianity nor Satanism inherently offers a better approach to addressing global warming based on the given context. The focus should be on modern practices and environmental policies rather than religious beliefs.",True

Was the Carnation Revolution the deadliest revolution in Europe?,"['The Carnation Revolution was initially a 25 April 1974 military coup in Lisbon which overthrew the authoritarian Estado Novo regime.', ""Its name arose from the fact that almost no shots were fired, and Celeste Caeiro offered carnations to the soldiers when the population took to the streets to celebrate the end of the dictatorship; other demonstrators followed suit, and carnations were placed in the muzzles of guns and on the soldiers' uniforms."", 'Portugal is a country located mostly on the Iberian Peninsula, in southwestern Europe.']","The Carnation Revolution, as described, was a peaceful uprising with almost no shots fired and a focus on celebration rather than violence. Since it was not characterized by significant loss of life, it is unlikely to be the deadliest revolution in Europe. Given that other revolutions in European history, such as the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution, are well-known for their high death tolls, it is safe to say that the Carnation Revolution was not the deadliest.

The Muslim desire to reclaim Jerusalem and the surrounding holy lands suggests a level of tension or competition with Israel, which controls these areas and considers them part of its territory. However, the term ""hostile"" implies a more general and widespread negative attitude or action, which may not be universally true for the entire Muslim world, as it is a diverse group of people with varying opinions.

The answer is 'False', as it is an overgeneralization to say the entire Muslim world is hostile to Israel. While there are certainly tensions and conflicts between Israel and many Muslim-majority countries and groups, it would be inaccurate to claim that all Muslims are hostile to Israel.",True

Is a northern fur seal needing emergency surgery in July likely a safe anesthesia candidate?,"['Northern fur seals fast throughout the mating season', 'It is recommended that patients, including animals, fast for a time before surgery that requires anesthesia ', 'Peak mating season for northern fur seals occurs in June and July']","First, note that northern fur seals fast during their mating season. The context states that the peak mating season for these seals occurs in June and July. Given that the seal in question needs surgery in July, it is likely that the animal is fasting as part of its natural mating behavior.

Second, it is a standard recommendation for both human and animal patients to fast before surgery that requires anesthesia to reduce the risk of complications related to stomach contents being aspirated into the lungs.

Considering these points, a fasting northern fur seal in July would generally not be a safe anesthesia candidate due to the increased risk of aspiration pneumonia associated with having an empty stomach during anesthesia. However, in an emergency situation, a veterinarian might make a judgment call to proceed with surgery and anesthesia while taking precautions to minimize the risk of aspiration.

The answer is 'Conditional - depending on the urgency of the surgery and the veterinarian's assessment of risk factors.'",True
Is being 5 year Capital One Venture member more cost effective than being in Church of Satan?,"['The Capital One Venture card has an annual fee of around $95.', 'The Church of Satan has a one time lifetime membership fee of $225.']","First, consider the cost of each option: the Capital One Venture card has an annual fee of $95, while the Church of Satan has a one-time lifetime membership fee of $225.
Next, calculate the cost for being a Capital One Venture member for 5 years: 5 years * $95/year = $475.
Now, compare the total cost of the Capital One Venture membership for 5 years with the one-time fee of the Church of Satan: $475 (5-year Venture cost) vs $225 (Satanist lifetime membership).
Since $225 is less than $475, being a 5-year Capital One Venture member is more expensive than being a one-time member of the Church of Satan.

Are two cans of Campbell's Soup a day good for hypertension?,"['Hypertension is a medical condition in which the blood pressure is high.', 'Salt increases blood pressure.', ""Campbell's Soup has an average of 1400 to 1800 mg of sodium (salt)."", 'The FDA states that sodium intake per day should not exceed 2300 mg.']","First, understand the context: hypertension is high blood pressure, and salt (sodium) intake can increase blood pressure. Campbell's Soup contains a high amount of sodium, with an average of 1400 to 1800 mg per can. The FDA recommends a daily sodium limit of 2300 mg.

Now, consider two cans of Campbell's Soup: this would amount to 2800 to 3600 mg of sodium per day. This exceeds the FDA's daily recommendation of 2300 mg.

Given this information, consuming two cans of Campbell's Soup a day would likely contribute to increased blood pressure, which is not good for someone with hypertension.

Is a krabby patty similar to a cheeseburger?,"['A krabby patty is a fictional sandwich featuring a patty on a split bun with toppings like lettuce, onion, and tomato.', 'A hamburger is typically served on a bun and offers toppings like lettuce, onion, and tomato.']","First, compare the components of a krabby patty and a cheeseburger: both are sandwiches served on a bun and include toppings like lettuce, onion, and tomato. The main difference lies in the patty itself: a krabby patty is described as being ""fictional"" and does not specify its ingredients, while a cheeseburger features a beef patty with cheese. However, without further information about the composition of a krabby patty, it's reasonable to assume that it could be similar to a cheeseburger if it also contains a meat patty similar to beef.

Is it true that gay male couples cannot naturally reproduce?,"['Gay men can have any of the various sex organs that humans have.', 'Trans men will sometimes become pregnant with their significant other before transitioning medically. ']","First, consider the context that gay men can have any of the various sex organs that humans have. This implies that some gay male couples may include individuals with female reproductive organs who could potentially conceive a child naturally.
Second, note that trans men, who were assigned female at birth, may become pregnant before transitioning medically and could conceive a child with their significant other.

However, if we focus specifically on gay male couples consisting of two individuals who are biologically male (having male reproductive organs), it is naturally impossible for them to conceive a child without assistance from third parties or medical intervention, such as using donor eggs and surrogates.

The answer is 'True' if considering the biological impossibility for two biologically male partners to naturally reproduce, but 'False' if one or both partners have or had female reproductive organs and are capable of conceiving without medical intervention. Depending on the interpretation of ""gay male couples,"" the answer could be either. In the strictest biological sense, the answer is 'True'.",False

Is starving Hamas agent eating pig bad?,"['Hamas is a Sunni-Islam fundamentalist group that strictly prohibits the eating of a pig.', 'Sunni Islam has a concept called the Law of Necessity.', 'The Law of Necessity states that, ""That which is necessary makes the forbidden permissible.""']","First, consider that Hamas is a Sunni-Islam fundamentalist group that prohibits the eating of pigs. However, Sunni Islam also has a concept called the Law of Necessity, which allows for exceptions to be made in cases of extreme necessity. If a starving Hamas agent were faced with the choice of eating pork to survive, this situation could potentially fall under the category of extreme necessity.

Given the context of the Law of Necessity, if the agent's life were in danger due to starvation and there were no other food options available, it would be permissible for them to eat the pig under these extraordinary circumstances.

Are Citizens of Bern Switzerland are descendants of Genghis Khan?,"['Genghis Khan had sixteen children.', '1 in 200 men are direct descendants of Genghis Khan.', 'Switzerland has a large Asian immigration population which was around 19,000 in 2018.']","First, consider that Genghis Khan had sixteen children, and approximately 1 in 200 men today carry DNA traceable to him. This indicates a significant number of descendants worldwide. Switzerland, with its large Asian immigration population, might include individuals with ancestry from the regions where Genghis Khan's descendants are more prevalent. However, being a citizen of Bern, Switzerland, does not automatically mean they are direct descendants of Genghis Khan; it could be one of many possible connections through history and migration.

The answer is 'False', as being a citizen of Bern, Switzerland, does not inherently mean they are direct descendants of Genghis Khan. It is possible that some individuals with Asian ancestry in Switzerland may have a genetic link to him, but it is not a guarantee for all citizens.",True

Does Dean Cain have less days to birthday than Will Ferrell every 4th of July?,"['Will Ferrell was born on July 16th.', 'Dean Cain was born on July 31st.']","First, we need to compare the number of days between the birthdays of Will Ferrell and Dean Cain. Will Ferrell's birthday is on July 16th, and Dean Cain's birthday is on July 31st. 

To find out how many days separate their birthdays, we subtract the day of Will Ferrell's birthday from Dean Cain's birthday:
31 (Dean Cain's birthday) - 16 (Will Ferrell's birthday) = 15 days

Now, we need to consider the 4th of July. Since both birthdays are after July 4th, every 4th of July, Dean Cain will have more days to his birthday than Will Ferrell because the 4th of July comes before both of their birthdays.

Lovecraft's Cthulhu is an ancient mystical being from eons ago.""]","First, understand the context: Palaeography is the study of ancient writings, which has been useful in decoding scripts from ancient civilizations like Anatolian hieroglyphics. H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu is an ancient mystical being, so any written records related to it would be from a very distant past.

However, Cthulhu is a fictional character created by Lovecraft and does not have actual historical or archaeological records associated with it. The stories and writings about Cthulhu are part of fiction and not real ancient texts that could be studied using paleography.

Would eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market be profitable for a steel company?,"['62% of bulk carriers are built in Japan', 'Bulk carrier hulls are made of steel']","First, consider the relationship between the Japanese bulk carrier market and the steel industry: a significant portion (62%) of bulk carriers are built in Japan, and the hulls of these carriers are made of steel. If competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market were eliminated, it could potentially lead to higher prices for bulk carriers, as there would be fewer builders to choose from.

Next, consider the potential impact on a steel company: if demand for bulk carriers increases due to reduced competition, the demand for steel to build these carriers would also likely increase. This increased demand for steel could lead to higher prices and potentially higher profits for the steel company, assuming they can meet the increased demand without significant additional costs.

However, it's important to note that other factors could also come into play, such as changes in global trade dynamics, regulations, or technological advancements that might affect the overall need for bulk carriers or the materials used to build them.

Given the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market might lead to higher demand for steel and potentially higher profits for a steel company, assuming no countervailing factors.

Although he was alive at the time of the battle, he was not yet involved in military campaigns with his father until 1300, two years after the Battle of Falkirk. Therefore, Edward II could not have been crucial to England's victory at the Battle of Falkirk as he did not participate in it. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a model be likely to frequently enjoy the menu at Cookout?,"['Models are known for being very thin on average.', 'Cookout serves high calorie American style barbecue food.', 'Models often have pressure put on them to maintain a slim figure.']","First, consider the typical physique of models, which is often very thin due to industry pressures. Second, note that Cookout serves high-calorie American-style barbecue food, which is generally not in line with a diet focused on maintaining a slim figure. Third, recognize that models may face pressure to maintain their weight, which might discourage them from frequently consuming high-calorie foods.

Given these points, it is likely that a model would not frequently enjoy the menu at Cookout due to the food's high calorie content and the potential impact on their image and professional requirements.

Do Leafhoppers compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources?,"['Leafhoppers are insects that feed on sap from trees.', 'Log Cabin is a  company that originated in Minnesota and makes several varieties of maple syrup.', 'Sap is an ingredient in maple syrup.']","First, identify the resources in question: Leafhoppers feed on sap from trees, and Log Cabin syrup producers require sap to make maple syrup. Next, consider the relationship between these resources: sap is a natural resource found in trees that both leafhoppers consume for sustenance and maple syrup producers utilize as an ingredient. However, leafhoppers are consumers of sap while syrup producers are harvesters, and they do not directly compete for the sap since their roles in the ecosystem are different. The interaction is more of a predator-prey or plant-herbivore relationship rather than competition for the same limited resource.

Would Paul Bunyan hypothetically be a poor choice for an urban planner?,"['Paul Bunyan was a legendary giant from tall tale stories.', 'Urban planners need to design buildings and ceilings in cities.', 'Paul Bunyan lived in the country side with a giant blue ox.', 'New York city apartment ceilings average around 8 feet in height.', 'Paul Bunyan was over seven feet tall.']","First, consider the characteristics of Paul Bunyan: he is a legendary giant from tall tale stories, known for his size, and he lived in the countryside with a giant blue ox. Next, consider the requirements for an urban planner: they need to design buildings and ceilings in cities, taking into account practical constraints like average ceiling heights. The context mentions that New York City apartment ceilings average around 8 feet in height.

Now, Paul Bunyan is over seven feet tall, which would make him taller than the average ceiling in a New York City apartment. This would likely present challenges for him in navigating and interacting with urban environments designed for humans of average height. As an urban planner, his size would be a hindrance when designing spaces for people of typical stature.

Therefore, Paul Bunyan's extraordinary height would make him a poor choice for an urban planner due to the practical constraints it would impose on his ability to design suitable living spaces. The answer is 'True'.",True
Did Harry Houdini appear on Chris Angel Mindfreak?,"['Chris Angel Mindfreak was released in 2005.', 'Harry Houdini died in 1926.']","First, consider the years of birth and death of Harry Houdini: he was born in 1874 and died in 1926.

Could a markhor give birth three times in a single year?,"['The gestation period of a markhor lasts 135–170 days.', 'There are 365 days in a year.']","First, calculate the minimum and maximum time between possible births for a markhor given its gestation period: 135 to 170 days. Next, compare this range to the number of days in a year, which is 365. If the minimum gestation period is greater than or equal to one year, it would be impossible for a markhor to give birth three times in a single year. 

135 days (minimum gestation) is less than 365 days (in a year), so it is theoretically possible for a markhor to give birth once within a year if the birth occurred on the last day of its gestation period and it were to become pregnant again immediately after giving birth. However, it is highly unlikely for a markhor to become pregnant again so quickly, as there would likely be a recovery period before it is receptive to mating again. 

Given these considerations, it is highly improbable for a markhor to give birth three times in a single year due to the biological constraints and the need for recovery time between pregnancies. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do some psychotherapy patients have no mental illness?,"['Psychotherapy is useful for couples navigating relationship issues.', 'Grief is a common reason that people seek psychotherapy.

Next, consider the duration of Eid al-Fitr, which is a three-day Muslim holiday.
Since the Triple Crown races occur on distinct days spread across weeks and Eid al-Fitr is only three consecutive days, it is not possible for a jockey to win all three races during the Eid al-Fitr holiday period.

Would a Common warthog starve in a greenhouse?,"['A greenhouse is an enclosed building in which plants are grown.', 'The Common warthog is an animal that feeds on grasses, roots, berries, and small insects.', 'Aphids, fungus gnats, and caterpillars, are common insects found in greenhouses.']","First, consider the diet of the Common warthog: it primarily feeds on grasses, roots, berries, and small insects. Next, note that greenhouses are enclosed buildings for growing plants, which may include various insects like aphids, fungus gnats, and caterpillars. While these insects could provide a supplementary food source, a greenhouse may not have enough grasses, roots, or berries to sustain a warthog's primary diet. The warthog would likely struggle to find sufficient food to meet its nutritional needs in a greenhouse environment.

Would alligator best saltwater crocodile in hypothetical Lake Urmia battle?,"['Lake Urmia is a salt lake in Iran.', 'Saltwater crocodiles have special glands that allow them to survive in salt water.', 'Alligators lack glands to stay in salt water for extended periods of time.']","First, consider the habitats of the two species: saltwater crocodiles are adapted to survive in saltwater environments, while alligators are more commonly found in fresh water. Lake Urmia is a salt lake, which gives the saltwater crocodile an advantage due to its specialized glands for coping with saltwater conditions. Alligators, lacking such glands, would likely struggle to survive and compete in a saltwater environment for an extended period.

Given the context, the saltwater crocodile would have a significant advantage in Lake Urmia's environment. Therefore, in a hypothetical battle between an alligator and a saltwater crocodile in Lake Urmia, the saltwater crocodile would likely emerge as the winner.

Was story of Jesus inspired by Egyptian myth?,"['Jesus was a biblical character that walked on water, was born of a virgin, and was killed beside two thieves.', 'Horus was a character in ancient Egyptian myth that walked on water, had a virgin mother, and was executed beside two thieves.']","First, we compare the similarities between the stories of Jesus and Horus as described in the context: both characters walked on water, had a virgin mother, and were executed beside two thieves. However, to determine if the story of Jesus was directly inspired by the Egyptian myth, we would need to examine historical and cultural connections between the two narratives, as well as any evidence of direct influence or adaptation.

There is a long-standing debate among scholars about possible cultural and mythological influences on the Jesus story, including potential connections to other ancient myths. However, it is important to note that the Gospels, which describe the life of Jesus, were written in a Jewish context and are primarily based on religious and theological beliefs rather than direct borrowings from other cultures.

While similarities may exist between various myths from different cultures, it is crucial to consider the distinct historical and religious contexts in which these stories developed. Without concrete evidence of direct influence or adaptation from the Egyptian myth of Horus, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the story of Jesus was inspired by it.

The answer is 'False', but with the understanding that the debate on influences in mythology and religious narratives continues among scholars.",True

Next, consider the context that in 2015, Fogle was found guilty of child molestation and possession of child pornography. This criminal activity is unrelated to Subway itself but does involve a former representative of the company. Subway terminated its relationship with Fogle after his guilt was established. The scandal is associated with Fogle, not directly with the company Subway, unless there was evidence of the company's involvement or knowledge, which is not mentioned in the context provided.

Did Jack Dempsey have most title fight wins in either of his weight classes?,"['Jack Dempsey competed as a heavyweight and a lightheavyweight.', 'Jack Dempsey only had a handful of title defenses as heavyweight champion.', 'Wladimir Klitschko had 25 heavyweight title fight wins.', 'Jack Dempsey did not hold the lightheavyweight title.', 'Dariusz Michalczewski had 23 lightheavyweight title fight wins.']","First, we need to determine the number of title fight wins Jack Dempsey had as a heavyweight. According to the context, he only had a handful of title defenses as a heavyweight champion, but the exact number is not provided. However, we know that Wladimir Klitschko had 25 heavyweight title fight wins, which is more than a handful.

Next, we consider Jack Dempsey's time as a lightheavyweight. He did not hold the lightheavyweight title, so he would have had no title fight wins in that division.

Comparing the available information, we can conclude that Jack Dempsey did not have the most title fight wins in either the heavyweight or lightheavyweight classes. Wladimir Klitschko had more heavyweight title wins, and since Dempsey didn't hold the lightheavyweight title, he couldn't have had any title fight wins there.

This indicates that the word is offensive to at least a significant portion of the Romani community. Second, note that Lady Gaga, a high-profile public figure, faced online criticism for using the word in her song title and lyrics, suggesting that many people are aware of the negative connotations associated with the term.

']","First, we establish that TMNT refers to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a popular media franchise. Next, we note that within the animated series of this franchise, the turtles are famously known for having a strong affinity for pizza. A coloring book based on the TMNT would likely include elements and themes from the show to be faithful to the source material and appeal to fans. Pizza is a prominent and iconic part of the turtles' diet in the animated series.

Therefore, it is highly probable that a TMNT coloring book would have images of pizza in it. The answer is 'True'.",True

Next, consider the context of the gift: it is for a mother who has experienced the loss of a stillborn baby, which is a different and more sensitive situation. Using stork wrapping paper in this case could unintentionally trigger伤心 or painful memories associated with the loss, as it directly relates to the arrival of a new baby that did not come to be.

However, elected officials in the UK can be removed from power before their term ends if they lose the support of their own political party or if a vote of no confidence is successful in the Parliament. A vote of no confidence can be called by any member of Parliament, and if a majority votes against the government, the Prime Minister would likely have to resign or call for new elections.

"When en route from China to France, must pilots know their altitude in the imperial foot?","['Most international airports and aviators use the foot to measure altitude ', 'China and North Korea require pilots to use meters for altitude', 'Pilots must communicate their altitude with local air traffic control ']","First, note that most international airports and aviators use feet to measure altitude. However, China and North Korea require pilots to use meters for altitude. Since the flight is from China to France, pilots would need to adhere to the altitude measurement requirements of both countries during different parts of the journey. They must also communicate their altitude with local air traffic control, which may require conversion between feet and meters depending on the country's regulations.

Given that the flight originates in China, where meters are required, the pilots would need to know their altitude in meters at the start. As they transition to international airspace and eventually enter French airspace, they would need to be able to convert their altitude to feet for communication with French air traffic control, which uses feet.

The answer is 'True', as pilots must be able to know their altitude in both imperial feet and metric meters to comply with the requirements of different countries and communicate effectively with air traffic control during the flight from China to France.",True

The antagonist snake character being made to sound like an Indian mag and having a dislike for men could be interpreted as cultural stereotyping. King Louie's portrayal is often seen as a racist stereotype of a black man.

Considering these elements, it is reasonable to conclude that The Jungle Book may contain racist subtext, particularly in the characterizations mentioned. However, it's important to note that interpretations of cultural insensitivity can vary, and some might argue that these elements are not intended to be racist.

Next, examine Jabberwocky: it is a 28-line poem by Lewis Carroll that employs nonsense words. Since Jabberwocky has 28 lines instead of the required 14 for a sonnet and does not follow the traditional rhyme scheme of a sonnet, it cannot be considered a sonnet. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is number of stars in Milky Way at least ten times earth's population?,"['The number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy is between 100 and 400 billion.', ""Earth's population in 2018 was 7.5 billion people.""]","First, consider the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is estimated to be between 100 and 400 billion stars. Next, consider Earth's population in 2018, which was 7.5 billion people. To determine if the number of stars is at least ten times Earth's population, we can compare the lower estimate of stars (100 billion) to the population (7.5 billion). 100 billion is significantly more than 7.5 billion, meaning it is at least ten times greater.

Can Paprika be made without a dehydrator?,"['Peppers can be dehydrated in the oven in lieu of a dehydrator.', 'Sunlight and heat have been used for centuries to dry peppers and other foods.']","First, consider the methods for dehydrating peppers mentioned in the context: using an oven or utilizing sunlight and heat. If a dehydrator is not available, these alternative methods can be employed to dry the peppers needed for making paprika.
Second, note that the primary purpose of a dehydrator is to provide a controlled, low-temperature environment for evenly drying food items. Ovens and natural sunlight with heat can achieve similar results, though the conditions may not be as consistent.

Given that peppers can be dehydrated using alternative methods, it is possible to make paprika without a dehydrator by first drying the peppers using an oven or sunlight and heat, and then grinding them into a powder.

Can The Hobbit be read in its entirety in four minutes?,"['The Hobbit is a 95,356 word book by J.R.R. Tolkien.', 'Speed reader Howard Stephen Berg could read at the speed of 25,000 words per minute.', 'Speed reader Maria Teresa Calderon from the Philippines claimed to be able to read 80,000 words per minute with 100% comprehension.']","First, calculate the time it would take to read The Hobbit at the speed of 25,000 words per minute, which is the speed of the slower speed reader mentioned. Then compare that time to four minutes.
If Howard Stephen Berg reads at 25,000 words per minute and The Hobbit is 95,356 words, it would take him 95,356 / 25,000 = 3.814 minutes to read the book. Since 3.814 minutes is less than four minutes, it is possible for someone reading at that speed to finish the book within four minutes. However, we should also consider Maria Teresa Calderon's claim of reading at 80,000 words per minute.
At 80,000 words per minute, it would take Maria Teresa Calderon 95,356 / 80,000 = 1.192 minutes to read The Hobbit. Again, this is less than four minutes.
Given these speeds, it is possible for someone with exceptional reading abilities like Howard Stephen Berg or Maria Teresa Calderon to read The Hobbit in its entirety in four minutes. The answer is 'True'.",True
Could Arnold Schwarzenegger hypothetically defeat Hafþór Björnsson in a powerlifting competition if both are at their peak strength?,"['A powerlifting competition is won by the person who lifts the most combined weight across the squat, deadlift, and bench press.', ""Arnold Schwarzenegger's powerlifting personal records are a 545 lb squat, 520 lb bench press, and a 710 lb deadlift."", ""Hafþór Björnsson's powerlifting personal records in competition are a 970 lb squat, 551 lb bench press, and a 904 lb deadlift.""]","First, compare the personal records of both athletes in the three powerlifting events: squat, bench press, and deadlift. Arnold Schwarzenegger's records are 545 lb squat, 520 lb bench press, and 710 lb deadlift. Hafþór Björnsson's records are 970 lb squat, 551 lb bench press, and 904 lb deadlift. Based on these numbers, Hafþór has higher records in all three events.

Second, consider that Hafþór Björnsson is a professional strongman competitor and has a higher lifting capacity compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was a bodybuilder and powerlifter but not at the same level of specialization as Hafþór.

Given the significantly higher lifting records of Hafþór Björnsson in all three powerlifting events, it is likely that he would defeat Arnold Schwarzenegger in a powerlifting competition if both were at their peak strength.

Morty's mother Beth also has instances of alcohol abuse and neglecting her children. Trauma triggers can happen when someone is reminded of a traumatic experience, such as living with alcoholic parents or experiencing abuse.

Given that ""Rich and Morty"" contains themes and behaviors related to alcoholism and neglect, it is plausible that children of alcoholics might find certain scenes or situations in the show triggering due to the resemblance to their own experiences.

Can members of the Green Party of England and Wales vote in the USA?,"[""Green Party of England Wales isn't registered in the USA."", ""People who live in England can't vote in the USA.""]","First, consider the registration of the Green Party of England and Wales in the USA: the party is not registered there. Second, consider the general rule for voting in the USA: only US citizens who are registered to vote in their state can vote, regardless of their political party affiliation. Since members of the Green Party of England and Wales are not automatically US citizens and the party is not registered in the USA, they would not be eligible to vote in US elections. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could you watch all of JAG in six months?,"['JAG has 227 episodes in the entire series.', 'Each episode of JAG is between 42-47 minutes long.', 'There are over 200,000 minutes in a month. ', 'The entire series of JAG is under 12,000 minutes. ']","First, calculate the total time required to watch all episodes of JAG by multiplying the number of episodes by the average length of an episode. 
227 episodes * (42 + 47) minutes / 2 = 227 * 44.5 minutes = approximately 10,093.5 minutes.

Next, compare the total time required to watch the series with the available time in six months.
Since there are over 200,000 minutes in a month, and the series is under 12,000 minutes, we can divide the total series time by the minutes in a month to see how many months it would take to watch it all.
10,093.5 minutes / (200,000 minutes/month) = approximately 0.05 months.

Given that six months is 6 * 30 = 180 days or 180 * 24 * 60 = 259,200 minutes, and the series is less than 12,000 minutes, it is clearly possible to watch the entire series within six months.

Do depressed people travel to the Golden Gate Bridge often?,"['The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most popular suicide spots in the USA.', 'Suicide is often caused by severe depression.']","First, consider the context that the Golden Gate Bridge is a well-known suicide spot in the USA. Second, understand that suicide is often linked to severe depression. However, it is important to note that depressed people do not inherently travel to the Golden Gate Bridge or any other suicide site; rather, the bridge is a destination for those in a crisis state.

While it may be true that some individuals with depression have visited the Golden Gate Bridge with suicidal intentions, it is not accurate to generalize that depressed people as a whole travel to the bridge frequently. Many people with depression do not attempt suicide, and even among those who do, not all choose the Golden Gate Bridge as a location.

The answer is 'False', as the statement implies a universal truth about depressed people that is not supported by the context provided. It's crucial to remember that individual experiences and actions vary greatly, and depression does not determine one's travel choices or behaviors.",True

There is no inherent connection between this behavior and the use of peaches.
Second, note that peach pits do contain amygdalin, which can break down into cyanide, a toxic compound for humans. However, this fact alone does not imply that a black widow woman would use peaches for any malicious purpose.
Third, it is not typical or logical to assume that a person, let alone a black widow, would use peaches specifically for their cyanide content to harm others, as there are easier and more accessible ways to obtain and use poison.

Given the context provided, there is no clear reason to believe that a black widow woman would have a specific use for peaches, especially for nefarious purposes. The answer is 'False'.",True

Would three commas be sufficient for displaying US 2018 GDP?,"['The 2018 GDP of US was 20.54 trillion dollars.', 'There are three commas in a billion.', 'There are four commas in a trillion.']","First, we need to determine the number of commas needed to represent the number of billions in the GDP. Since there are four commas in a trillion and the GDP is 20.54 trillion dollars, we would expect four commas to represent the entire number. However, standard practice in formatting large numbers is to use commas as thousands separators, so we would only expect three commas to separate every three digits after the first group of three.

Given that the GDP is 20.54 trillion, which can be written as 20,540,000,000,000 dollars, three commas would indeed be sufficient for proper display.

The Great Recession had a peak unemployment rate of 10%. The Great Depression saw unemployment approach 25%. In May 2020, US unemployment numbers approached 15% due to the Coronavirus, but this is a specific month and not the entire duration of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic.

Is 500GB USB device enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day?,"['5 hours of Netflix programming uses up approximately 1 TB of data.', '1 TB is equal to 1000 GB of data.']","First, calculate the data usage for 10 hours of Netflix shows per day: if 1.5 hours of programming uses 1 TB of data, then 10 hours would be 10 / 1.5 = 6.67 times the data usage. 

Now, convert the data usage back to GB since the USB device is measured in GB: 6.67 TB * 1000 GB/TB = 6670 GB.

Given that the USB device has a capacity of 500 GB, we can compare this to the calculated data usage for 10 hours of Netflix per day.

This increases the exposure to sunlight. Second, note that the event attracts many young people who typically wear minimal clothing for both the weather and fashion reasons, which leaves more skin exposed to the sun. Given these factors, people are more likely to be sunburned at Burning Man due to increased sun exposure and less clothing providing protection. The answer is 'True'.",True

Could two newborn American Black Bear cubs fit on a king size bed?,"['The average size of an American Black Bear cub is only 8 inches at birth.', 'King size beds are 76""x80"" in size.']","First, consider the size of an American Black Bear cub at birth, which is given as 8 inches. Next, take into account the dimensions of a king size bed, which measures 76 inches in length and 80 inches in width. Given that two cubs would require space not only for their length but also for their width when placed side by side, it's likely that they would fit on the bed given the ample surface area. Assuming an average width of around 4 inches for each cub (which is a rough estimate as cubs are not exactly square), together they would take up approximately 8 inches in length and 8 inches in width, well within the dimensions of a king size bed.

Is strep throat harmless to singer Rita Ora after her 2020 tonsilitis surgery?,"['Tonsilitis is an inflammation of the tonsils.', 'Singer Rita Ora had her tonsils removed in February of 2020 due to tonsilitis.', 'Strep throat can still grow in the throat of people without tonsils.']","First, understand that tonsilitis is an inflammation of the tonsils, and Rita Ora had her tonsils removed in 2020 because of this issue. Second, recognize that even after a person has their tonsils removed, they can still get infections like strep throat, which can affect the throat. Since Rita Ora no longer has tonsils, strep throat would not manifest as tonsilitis, but it could still impact her throat health.

The answer is 'True', but with the clarification that while strep throat would not affect her tonsils specifically, it could still cause throat issues for her.",False

Does Adobe Suite have video game engine coding?,"['Adobe applications runs on the C++ framework.', 'Many video games are run on Unity game engine.', 'The Unity game engine is a C++ coded engine.']","First, note that Adobe applications run on the C++ framework, which is a programming language often used in game development. However, the context mentions that many video games are run on the Unity game engine, which is specifically a C++ coded engine. While Adobe Suite includes a variety of software for creating digital content, it does not primarily focus on game engine development.

The Unity game engine, which is separate from Adobe Suite, is a popular choice for game development and is coded in C++. Adobe Suite may be used for creating assets and content that can be integrated into games developed with Unity or other engines, but it does not have a built-in video game engine for coding games directly.

Would someone on Venus be unlikely to experience hypothermia?,"['Hypothermia typically occurs from exposure to extreme cold.', 'The average surface temperature on Venus is 863°F.', 'A warmer surface temperature on the planet will result in a higher body temperature for people on that planet.']","First, understand that hypothermia occurs when the body's core temperature drops due to exposure to cold temperatures. The context states that the average surface temperature on Venus is 863°F, which is extremely hot. A warmer surface temperature would likely cause a person's body temperature to rise, not drop.

Given that Venus has an average surface temperature well above the threshold for human survival and that heat, not cold, would be the primary concern for someone on Venus, it is highly unlikely that they would experience hypothermia.

Is Jack Black unlikely to compete with Bear McCreary for an award?,"['Jack Black is a musician but not a composer', 'Bear McCreary is a composer', 'Their interests are similar but their skills not overlap in awards categories']","First, consider the professions of Jack Black and Bear McCreary: Jack Black is a musician but not a composer, while Bear McCreary is a composer. Awards in the field of music, particularly for film and television scores, are typically given to composers for their original work. Since Jack Black's skills are in music performance rather than composition, he would not typically be eligible for awards that are specifically designed for composers like Bear McCreary.

Are pennies commonly used in Canada?,"['Canada used pennies historically as one cent coins.', 'Canada stopped minting pennies in 2012. ']","First, consider the historical use of pennies in Canada: they were used as one cent coins. However, the context also states that Canada stopped minting pennies in 2012. This suggests that pennies are no longer being produced, which could indicate a decrease in their circulation and use. Given that new pennies are not being created, it is reasonable to assume that they are not as commonly used in Canada as they once were. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do drag kings take testosterone to look masculine?,"['Drag Kings will use contouring and makeup to make their facial features appear more masculine and chiseled. ', 'Testosterone is prescribed for transgender men to help with transitioning and dysphoria.', 'Drag kings often identify as women, but dress as men for show.']","First, consider the context provided: Drag kings are performers who identify as women but dress and present as men for entertainment purposes. They use makeup and contouring techniques to enhance masculine features. Testosterone is a hormone prescribed for transgender men to support their physical transition, not for drag performers who do not typically undergo hormonal transitions as part of their performance.

Can E6000 cure before a hoverboard finishes the Daytona 500? ,"['The Daytona 500 is 500 miles', 'A hoverboard can move at six to eight miles per hour', 'E6000 fully cures in 24 to 72 hours']","First, calculate the time it would take for a hoverboard to finish the Daytona 500 at six to eight miles per hour. Assuming the hoverboard maintains a constant speed, we can use the lower bound of the speed range for a conservative estimate. 

Distance = Speed × Time
500 miles = 6 miles/hour × Time
Time = 500 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time ≈ 83.33 hours

Now, compare this time to the curing time of E6000.

E6000 fully cures in 24 to 72 hours.

Since 83.33 hours is greater than the maximum curing time of E6000 (72 hours), the E6000 would have enough time to cure before the hoverboard completes the Daytona 500.

Are Aldi's foods discounted due to being out of date?,"['Aldi cuts costs by charging for bags, buying in bulk, and by avoiding brand name items. ', 'Aldi removes spoiled or expired foods from their shelves immediately upon identification.']","First, consider the context provided: Aldi focuses on cost-cutting measures such as charging for bags, buying in bulk, and not stocking brand name items. This suggests that their lower prices are achieved through efficiency and economies of scale rather than selling expired products.
Second, the context also states that Aldi promptly removes spoiled or expired foods from their shelves. This indicates that the store maintains quality control and does not sell products past their expiration date.

Based on this information, Aldi's foods are discounted primarily due to their business model rather than being out of date. The answer is 'False'.",False

', 'Many jewelry stores offer necklaces with the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ.']","First, consider the context that the crucifixion of Jesus is a common symbol used by Catholics and other Christian denominations. This suggests that it holds religious significance for a significant portion of the population. Next, note that jewelry stores offer necklaces with the Crucifixion, which indicates that it is not uncommon to display this image as a personal item. 

Given the widespread religious acceptance and the availability of such items in mainstream stores, it can be concluded that it is socially acceptable for individuals, particularly those who are Christian, to wear an icon depicting the crucifixion. However, social acceptance may vary depending on the cultural and personal beliefs of those around the wearer. In a diverse society, some may find it more acceptable than others, but within Christian communities, it is generally considered acceptable.

Would it be unusual to use paypal for drug deals?,"['Paypal prohibits the use of their platform for drugs or drug paraphernalia. ', 'Using paypal leaves a digital footprint of any drug purchase.']","First, consider the platform's policies: Paypal explicitly prohibits the use of their service for drugs or drug paraphernalia. Second, consider the nature of the transaction: using Paypal involves electronic transactions, which leave a digital trail that could be traced back to the users involved in the drug deal.

Is Casio's founding year a composite number?,"['Electronics company Casio was founded in 1946.', 'A composite number is a number that can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.', '1946 can be divided by 278 and 7.']","First, identify the founding year of Casio: 1946. Next, check if 1946 is a composite number by determining if it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself. The context provides two divisors, 278 and 7, which means 1946 is divisible by these numbers. Therefore, 1946 is a composite number. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is it hard to get a BLT in Casablanca?,"['A BLT is a sandwich consisting of bacon, lettuce and tomato', 'Casablanca is predominantly Muslim', 'Islam forbids the consumption of pork and pork products']","First, understand that a BLT is a sandwich made with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Next, consider the context that Casablanca is predominantly Muslim. In Islam, the consumption of pork and pork products is forbidden.

Can a snow leopard eat twice its own body weight?,"['The average snow leopard weighs 72 pounds.', 'The favorite food of snow leopards is an ibex.', 'The average weight of an ibex is 150 pounds.']","First, we need to determine if a snow leopard can consume a weight equivalent to twice its own body weight. The average snow leopard weighs 72 pounds. To eat twice its own body weight, a snow leopard would need to consume 72 pounds * 2 = 144 pounds.

Next, we consider the average weight of an ibex, which is the snow leopard's favorite food. An ibex weighs 150 pounds, which is more than the 144 pounds required for a snow leopard to eat twice its own body weight.

However, it is important to note that while an ibex is heavier than the amount of weight a snow leopard would need to eat, it is unlikely for a snow leopard to consume an entire ibex in one sitting, as they typically hunt smaller prey and may share kills with other leopards.

Nonetheless, based on the given weights, a snow leopard could potentially consume an ibex that would allow it to eat a quantity equivalent to twice its own body weight, even if it doesn't do so in a single feeding.

Would half muggle wizards fear Lord Voldemort?,"['Lord Voldemort created a slur to describe half muggle wizards, calling them mudbloods.', 'Lord Voldemort sought to purge the wizarding world of half muggle wizards through death.']","First, consider Lord Voldemort's views and actions towards half muggle wizards: he not only created a derogatory term for them but also had a goal to eliminate them from the wizarding world. This indicates a clear threat and hostility towards this group.
Second, understand the potential fear this would instill: knowing that someone seeks to harm or eradicate you or your kind would naturally inspire fear.

Given Voldemort's hatred and targeted violence towards half muggle wizards, it is reasonable to assume that they would fear him.

Next, note that a theocracy involves religious leaders having power. Finally, consider the context that Friar Girolamo Savonarola, a religious figure, ruled Florence from 1494 to 1498.

Given that Savonarola, a religious leader, held power in Florence during a period that falls within the Italian Renaissance, it is accurate to say that Florence was under a theocratic rule during that specific time within the Renaissance.

Were Beauty and the Beast adaptations devoid of Kurt Sutter collaborators?,"['Beauty and the Beast is a fairy tale adapted into several movie and TV shows.', 'Kurt Sutter created the TV series Sons of Anarchy and The Shield.', 'Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman starred in Sons of Anarchy.', 'Ron Perlman starred in the TV series Beauty and the Beast which aired from 1987-1990.']","First, we identify that Kurt Sutter is not directly involved in the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale itself. The context then introduces Kurt Sutter's association with the TV series Sons of Anarchy and The Shield, as well as the actors Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman who were part of Sons of Anarchy. Ron Perlman is also mentioned to have starred in a TV series adaptation of Beauty and the Beast from 1987-1990.

Since Ron Perlman, who has collaborated with Kurt Sutter, was part of a Beauty and the Beast adaptation, it means that there has been at least one instance where a Beauty and the Beast adaptation did involve a Kurt Sutter collaborator.

This indicates that individuals in the field of music have been honored with knighthood. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is Samsung accountable to shareholders?,"['Samsung is a publicly traded company.', 'Publicly traded companies are ultimately accountable to shareholders. ']","First, consider the nature of Samsung: it is a publicly traded company. Publicly traded companies have shares that are listed on a stock exchange, making them owned by a diverse group of shareholders. Second, understand the general principle of public companies: they are ultimately accountable to their shareholders because shareholders have invested in the company and have a vested interest in its success. Shareholders can influence the company's direction through voting rights and have the ability to sell their shares if they are dissatisfied with the company's performance.

Is Alan Alda old enough to have fought in the Vietnam War?,"['Alan Alda was born in 1936.', 'The Vietnam War was from 1955 to 1975, with American involvement from 1965 to 1973.', 'American soldiers must be at least 18 years old.', 'Alan Alda was 29 in 1965.']","First, calculate Alan Alda's age in 1965: he was born in 1936, so in 1965, he would be 29 years old. The Vietnam War with American involvement started in 1965, and American soldiers must be at least 18 years old. Since Alan Alda was 29 in 1965, he was older than the minimum age requirement for military service at the beginning of American involvement in the Vietnam War. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can a lemon aggravate dyspepsia?,"['Dyspepsia is a condition where the stomach is irritated.', 'Lemons are highly acidic fruits.', 'Common stomach irritants include alcohol, coffee, and acidic foods.']","First, understand that dyspepsia is a condition characterized by an irritated stomach. Lemons are known to be highly acidic fruits, and acidic foods are listed as common stomach irritants. Given that lemons have acidic properties and stomach irritation is a symptom of dyspepsia, it is plausible that consuming lemons could potentially aggravate the condition for some individuals.

Did Disney's second film rip off a prophet story?,"[""Disney's second film, Pinocchio, was released in 1940."", 'The biblical prophet Jonah was swallowed by a whale.', 'In Pinocchio, Gepetto is swallowed by a giant whale while searching for Pinocchio.']","First, we establish that Disney's second film, Pinocchio, was released in 1940. Next, we consider the biblical story of Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale. Lastly, we note that in Pinocchio, Gepetto experiences a similar event when he is swallowed by a giant whale during his search for Pinocchio. While this could be seen as a parallel or inspiration, it is not necessarily an intentional rip-off, as storytelling elements often get reimagined and reused throughout history. Without evidence of direct plagiarism or intent to deceive, it's difficult to definitively label it as a rip-off. The answer is 'False'.",True
Would a Nike shoebox be too small to fit a swan in?,"['Nike Shoeboxes are usually 14"" x 10"" x 5"".', 'An average swan is 4-5.6 ft in length.']","First, calculate the volume of the Nike shoebox: 14 inches * 10 inches * 5 inches = 700 cubic inches.
Next, consider the size of an average swan, which is 4-5.6 feet in length. Convert the length to inches (1 foot = 12 inches) to get 48-67.2 inches.
Assuming a swan has a similar cylindrical shape, we can estimate its volume by multiplying its length by a reasonable average girth (diameter). For simplicity, let's assume a diameter of 1 foot (12 inches). So, the volume of a cylindrical swan would be π * (diameter/2)^2 * length.
For a 48-inch swan: π * (12/2)^2 * 48 ≈ 3628.8 cubic inches.
For a 67.2-inch swan: π * (12/2)^2 * 67.2 ≈ 5123.52 cubic inches.

Both estimates of the swan's volume are significantly larger than the volume of the Nike shoebox. Therefore, a Nike shoebox would be too small to fit a swan. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would Jackie Chan have trouble communicating with a deaf person?,"['Jackie Chan speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and American Sign Language.', 'American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada.']","First, consider the languages Jackie Chan is reported to know: Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and American Sign Language (ASL). Since American Sign Language is a language used by deaf communities, including in the United States and Canada, it is designed for communication with deaf individuals. If Jackie Chan knows ASL, he should be able to communicate with a deaf person who uses that language.

Is eating a Dicopomorpha echmepterygis size Uranium pellet fatal?,"['Dicopomorpha echmepterygis is a wingless insect that is .13mm large.', 'Uranium is a radioactive element that is dangerous if ingested in large doses.', '25mg of Uranium would cause kidney damage, while 50mg would cause complete kidney failure in humans.']","First, consider the size of the Dicopomorpha echmepterygis, which is .13mm large. This is an extremely small size. Next, consider the context about Uranium: it is dangerous if ingested in large doses, with 25mg causing kidney damage and 50mg causing complete kidney failure in humans.

A Dicopomorpha echmepterygis-sized Uranium pellet would be incredibly tiny, likely containing a negligible amount of Uranium compared to the doses mentioned that cause harm to humans. It is highly unlikely that such a small amount of Uranium would be fatal or even have any significant effect on a human.

Was Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law be considered fair in the US now?,"['Oscar Wilde was imprisoned for sexual indecency that amounted to having sexual relations with another man.', 'In the United States, being gay is not a punishable offense. ']","First, consider the context: Oscar Wilde was imprisoned for sexual indecency that amounted to having sexual relations with another man. In the present context, the United States does not criminalize homosexuality; being gay is not a punishable offense.

Given that Oscar Wilde's imprisonment was based on his sexual orientation, which is now not a criminal offense in the United States, his treatment under the law would not be considered fair by current US standards.

Could a fan of the Botany Swarm vote for John Key?,"['The Botany Swarm is a hockey team based in Auckland, New Zealand', 'John Key is the Prime Minister of New Zealand']","First, consider the context of the question: The Botany Swarm is a hockey team, and John Key is the Prime Minister of New Zealand. Being a fan of a sports team does not preclude someone from voting for a particular political figure, as these are separate interests. There is no information given that would suggest a fan of the Botany Swarm is unable or forbidden from voting for John Key. The answer is 'True'.",True
Will Conan the Barbarian hypothetically last a short time inside of Call of Duty?,"['Conan the Barbarian is a comic book character.', 'Conan the Barbarian is equipped with a sword and does not typically wear armor.', 'Call of Duty is a modern warfare video game.', 'Soldiers in Call of Duty are equipped with weapons like sniper rifles, shotguns, and machine guns.']","First, consider the nature of Conan the Barbarian as a comic book character who is armed with a sword and typically does not wear armor. Next, consider the setting and equipment of Call of Duty, which is a modern warfare video game where soldiers use advanced firearms like sniper rifles, shotguns, and machine guns. Given the mismatch in weaponry and protection between Conan and the modern soldiers in Call of Duty, it is highly likely that Conan would not last long in such an environment due to the technological superiority of the weapons used in the game.

We need to determine if Iowa required the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools during their childhood.

Context states that all states except California, Hawaii, Iowa, Vermont, and Wyoming required the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. Since Iowa is on the list of exceptions, it means that Jackson Pollock's parents were not required to say the Pledge of Allegiance as children in Iowa.

Do pirates care about vitamin C?,"['Scurvy is caused by a prolonged period of time without Vitamin C', 'People spending long periods of time at sea without to vitamin C are at high risk for scurvy', 'Pirates spend long periods of time at sea']","First, understand that scurvy is a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C. People who spend extended periods without adequate vitamin C, such as those at sea, are at risk for developing scurvy. Pirates, who spent long periods of time at sea, would therefore be at risk for scurvy if they did not have access to vitamin C-rich foods.

"In the world of Harry Potter, would a snake and skull tattoo be good luck?","['In Harry Potter, a tattoo of a snake and a skull is a symbol of being a ""Death Eater.""', 'Death Eaters are people who follow the word of the dark lord Voldemort, who is considered wicked and cruel.', 'Death Eaters are not embraced in the wizarding communities of Harry Potter.']","First, understand the context: in the Harry Potter series, a tattoo of a snake and a skull represents a Death Eater, someone loyal to the dark lord Voldemort. Death Eaters are associated with evil and are generally feared and despised within the wizarding world. 

Given that Death Eaters are considered wicked and are not well-regarded in the wizarding communities, a snake and skull tattoo would not be considered good luck. On the contrary, it would likely bring fear and negative attention.

Did King of Portuguese people in 1515 have familial ties to the Tudors?,"['Manuel I was King of Portugal from 1495 to 1521.', 'Manuel I of Portugal married Maria of Aragon.', 'Maria of Aragon was the sister of Catherine of Aragon.', 'Catherine of Aragon was the first wife of Henry VIII and was one of a handful that he did not behead.']","First, identify the key relationships in the context: Manuel I of Portugal married Maria of Aragon, who was the sister of Catherine of Aragon. Catherine of Aragon was the first wife of Henry VIII, who was the King of England during the Tudor period.

Since Manuel I's wife was related to Henry VIII by being his wife's sister, there is a familial connection between the two. Therefore, the King of Portuguese people in 1515 (Manuel I) had familial ties to the Tudors through his marriage to Maria of Aragon.

Could Darth Vader hypothetically catch the Coronavirus?,"['The Coronavirus is transferred through infected droplets that can get into eyes, nose, or mouth.', 'Darth Vader permanently wears an iron weave helmet that he needs to breathe.']","First, consider the method of transmission for the Coronavirus: it spreads through infected droplets that can enter the eyes, nose, or mouth. Next, consider Darth Vader's unique situation: he permanently wears an iron weave helmet that provides him with oxygen and serves as a life support system. This helmet covers his entire head, including his mouth and nose, and would likely prevent direct exposure to infected droplets.

However, it's important to note that the helmet might not protect Vader's eyes, which could still be a point of entry for the virus. Additionally, if the virus were present on the surfaces of his helmet or his environment, and he were to touch those surfaces and then touch his eyes, it's theoretically possible for him to contract the virus.

Given these considerations, while the helmet offers some protection, it's not a foolproof barrier against all possible modes of transmission. Therefore, Darth Vader could hypothetically catch the Coronavirus, although the likelihood might be lower than for someone not wearing such protective gear.

The answer is 'True', with the understanding that the likelihood is potentially lower due to his helmet providing some protection.",False

The Supreme Court of Canada consists of nine justices.

Now, consider the requirements of a Lucha trios match.

Artillery examples include howitzers, mortars, and rockets, which have significant ranges. A slingshot, on the other hand, is a simple string weapon that propels small projectiles, with a much shorter range compared to artillery devices. Slingshots can fire projectiles up to 9m, while mortars can have a range of up to 4,680m.

The run time of Batman (1989 film) is two hours and six minutes. This means there would be enough time to show the movie during the flight.

Next, consider the rating of the film, which is PG-13. The average age group of passengers on this flight is 18-34, so a PG-13 movie would generally be suitable for most passengers.

Lastly, airlines have relaxed their rules for in-flight movies in recent years, even showing R-rated movies. Given this context, it's likely that a PG-13 film like Batman (1989) would be considered appropriate for showing on such a flight.

Did Irish mythology inspire Washington Irving?,"[""Washington Irving's most famous novel was The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."", 'The antagonist of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, The Headless Horseman, was a man on horseback that was missing his head.', 'The Dullahan is a mythological creature in Irish mythology.', 'The Dullahan comes from the Irish word Gan Ceann, meaning ""without a head"".', 'The Dullahan is depicted as a headless rider, usually on a black horse, who carries their own head in their arm.']","First, we identify the relevant points from the context: Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow features a headless horseman, and the Dullahan from Irish mythology is also a headless rider. Next, we consider if there is a connection between the two: the similarity in the description of the headless horseman and the Dullahan might suggest an influence.

However, without specific information about Irving's sources of inspiration or references to Irish mythology in his work, we cannot definitively conclude that Irish mythology directly inspired The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. The similarity could be coincidental or based on a common folklore theme.

The answer is 'False', as there is not enough evidence to confirm that Irish mythology specifically inspired Washington Irving.",True
"At midnight in Times Square on New Years Eve, are you likely to meet people in diapers?","[""Times Square holds an enormous gathering on New Year's Eve."", 'There are no portable restrooms in Times Square.', 'People begin waiting for the midnight event in Times Square before 10 a.m.']","First, consider the context of the New Year's Eve event in Times Square: it is an enormous gathering that attracts large crowds, and people often begin waiting for the midnight event as early as 10 a.m. However, there are no portable restrooms available in the area. This means that people may need to find alternative solutions for their bathroom needs throughout the day and night.

Given the long duration people spend waiting and the lack of restroom facilities, it is not uncommon for some individuals to take precautions to avoid needing to use the restroom during this time. One such precaution might be wearing diapers, especially for those who are particularly concerned about the inconvenience or impossibility of finding a bathroom.

Therefore, it is likely that at midnight in Times Square on New Year's Eve, you might encounter people wearing diapers as a practical solution to the restroom situation. The answer is 'True'.",True

Does Masaharu Morimoto rely on glutamic acid?,"['Masaharu Morimoto is a Japanese chef', 'Japanese cuisine relies on several forms of seaweed as ingredients and flavorings for broth like kombu dashi', 'Glutamic acid has been identified as the flavoring component in kombu seaweed']","First, we know that Masaharu Morimoto is a Japanese chef, and Japanese cuisine often uses kombu dashi, a broth made from seaweed, as a flavoring. Next, we learn that glutamic acid is the flavoring component found in kombu seaweed. Given that kombu dashi is a key ingredient in Japanese cooking and Morimoto's cuisine, it is reasonable to assume that his dishes, which would include traditional elements, might incorporate the glutamic acid from kombu. Therefore, Morimoto likely relies on glutamic acid for flavor in his dishes. The answer is 'True'.",True

Would a nickel fit inside a koala pouch?,"[""Koala joeys (babies) enter their mother's pouch when they are about 2 to 3 centimeters long."", 'An American nickel is 2.12 centimeters in diameter.']","First, we need to compare the size of a koala joey's pouch entrance to the diameter of a nickel. A koala joey enters its mother's pouch when it is about 2 to 3 centimeters long, which includes the width of the entrance. An American nickel is 2.12 centimeters in diameter.

Since the diameter of a nickel (2.12 cm) is greater than or equal to the width of the pouch entrance (which is at least 2 centimeters), a nickel would not fit inside a koala pouch without causing discomfort or obstruction to the joey.

Can olive oil kill rabies?,"['Olive oil is a fat used in cooking.', 'Olive oil is made up of palmitic acid which is a weak acid found in plants and animals.', 'Rabies is a disease from an infected animal bite.', 'Rabies is treated by a shot containing immunoglobuin, a protein that is found in plasma cells.', 'Plasma cells are found in the bone marrow of humans.']","First, consider the properties of olive oil: it is a fat used in cooking and is composed of palmitic acid, a weak acid found in plants and animals. Next, understand the nature of rabies: it is a viral disease transmitted through the bite of an infected animal and is treated with a shot containing immunoglobulin, a protein produced by plasma cells in the bone marrow.

Olive oil, being a cooking fat and not a medical treatment, does not have any known antiviral properties to combat rabies. The treatment for rabies relies on the administration of immunoglobulin, which is a specific protein that helps the immune system recognize and neutralize the virus. Olive oil does not contain this protein or any other components that would be effective in treating or killing the rabies virus.

Can an adult human skull hypothetically pass through the birth canal?,"['The largest baby ever born was 22 pounds. ', 'The average human skull weighs between 10 and 11 pounds.']","First, consider the weight of the average human skull, which is between 10 and 11 pounds. Next, consider the weight of the largest recorded baby, which was 22 pounds. The skull is a significant part of a baby's weight, but it is not the only factor. Babies are born with a degree of flexibility in their skulls, which helps them pass through the birth canal. While an adult skull would not be able to flex in the same way, we are comparing the weight of the skull alone and not the entire baby.

Given that the average human skull is significantly lighter than the heaviest recorded baby, and that a baby's skull is capable of significant deformation during birth, it is reasonable to assume that an adult human skull, if isolated from the rest of the body and without the flexibility that a baby's skull possesses, would be smaller in size than the largest recorded baby and could potentially pass through the birth canal in theory.

However, this is a hypothetical scenario and not a practical or safe situation. In reality, adult skulls do not go through the birth canal, and this question is more of a thought experiment.

The answer is 'True', considering the comparison of weights and the hypothetical nature of the question, but it's important to note that this is not a typical or safe situation.",True

Next, note the duration of the holiday, which lasts from 1 to 3 days, depending on the country. Comparing this to the time required to watch the entire US Office, which is 4 days, 3 hours, and 30 minutes, it would not be feasible to watch the entire series during the short holiday period of Eid al-Fitr. Additionally, engaging in extensive screen time may not align with the religious and familial focus of the holiday.

Would a viewer of Monday Night Football be able to catch WWE Raw during commercial breaks?,"['Monday Night Football begins at 8pm EST on Monday nights during the NFL season', 'WWE Raw airs on Monday nights between 8pm and 11pm EST']","First, we need to determine the overlapping time periods between Monday Night Football and WWE Raw. Monday Night Football starts at 8pm EST and WWE Raw also airs on Monday nights from 8pm to 11pm EST. This means that WWE Raw is airing simultaneously with the start of Monday Night Football.

During Monday Night Football, there are commercial breaks throughout the broadcast. The length and frequency of these breaks can vary, but it's common for there to be several breaks per hour.

Given that WWE Raw is on the air during the entire duration of Monday Night Football, it is possible for a viewer to switch to WWE Raw during one of the commercial breaks of Monday Night Football if they have access to both channels and can quickly switch between them.

Did Sony definitively win the video game war against Sega?,"['Sony is the maker of the Playstation which has sold over 108 million PS4 units by March 2020.', ""Sega's last console, the Sega Dreamcast, was discontinued in 2001."", ""Sony Playstation competed with Sega's Dreamcast and Saturn systems in the 1990s."", 'Sega now makes games for its former competitor, Sony, including Team Sonic Racing in 2019.', 'At the height of the console wars, Sega Saturn sold 9.5 million units while Sony Playstation sold 102 million units.']","First, consider the sales figures of the competing consoles during the 1990s: Sony's Playstation sold 102 million units, while Sega Saturn sold only 9.5 million units. This indicates a significant market advantage for Sony. Second, note that Sega discontinued its last console, the Dreamcast, in 2001, signifying a retreat from the home console market. Since then, Sega has been developing games for Sony's consoles, like Team Sonic Racing in 2019, which suggests a continued presence in the gaming industry but not as a console manufacturer. Given these facts, it is reasonable to say that Sony won the video game war against Sega. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would four shoes be insufficient for a set of octuplets?,"['There are eight children in a set of octuplets.', 'The typical child is born with two feet.', 'Normally each foot needs to be covered with a single shoe.']","First, consider the number of children in a set of octuplets, which is eight. Each child typically has two feet, requiring two shoes per child to cover both feet. To find out if four shoes would be insufficient, we calculate the total number of shoes needed for all eight children.

Can black swan's formation type help spell longest word in Dictionary?,"['Black swan\'s fly in a ""V"" formation.', 'The longest word in the dictionary is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.']","First, consider the formation type of black swans: they fly in a ""V"" shape. Next, examine the longest word in the dictionary, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, which has 45 letters. To spell out this word using the ""V"" formation of black swans, each letter would need to be represented by the shape of the birds in the formation. However, it is unlikely that the specific arrangement of birds in a ""V"" could form each of the distinct letters in the word, especially considering the complexity of some of the letters (such as 'u', 'c', 'v', and 'x').

Would Alexander Graham Bell hypothetically support Nazi eugenics?,"['Eugenics was the idea of selective breeding or sterilization to rid the human populace of certain traits.', 'Nazis used eugenics to justify mass sterilization and mass murder.', 'Alexander Graham Bell Alexander Graham Bell advocated against the use of sign language and hoped to eradicate deafness through selective breeding.']","First, understand the context: Eugenics is the practice of improving the human population by controlled breeding or sterilization to eliminate undesirable traits. Nazis used eugenics to justify heinous acts like mass sterilization and genocide. Alexander Graham Bell was against the use of sign language and advocated for selective breeding to prevent deafness.

Now, consider Bell's views on deafness and selective breeding. Although he did not support sign language and advocated for the eradication of deafness through selective breeding, it is crucial to note that his ideas were rooted in a different time and context. The Nazi implementation of eugenics was far more extreme and morally reprehensible.

However, it is not possible to definitively say whether Bell would have supported Nazi eugenics, as his views were not specifically about race or the methods employed by the Nazis. It is important to remember that historical figures' beliefs should be evaluated within their own time frames and not necessarily projected onto later events.

Can you purchase a dish with injera at Taco Bell?,"['Taco Bell serves a variety of Mexican and Tex-Mex foods that include tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and nachos.', 'Injera is a sour fermented flatbread with a slightly spongy texture, traditionally made out of teff flour.', 'Injera is part of Ethiopian cuisine.']","First, consider the types of food served at Taco Bell, which includes tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and nachos - all of which are Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes. Next, note that injera is a traditional Ethiopian food, not a component of Mexican or Tex-Mex cuisine. Since Taco Bell serves a specific type of cuisine that does not include injera, it is not available for purchase there. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can the original name of the zucchini be typed on the top row of a QWERTY keyboard?,"['The original name for the zucchini in Mexican language or Nahuatl is ayokonetl.', 'The top row of a QWERTY keyboard contains the keys q, w, e, r, t, y, u, i , o, and p.']","First, examine the letters in the original name of the zucchini, ayokonetl. Now, compare these letters to the keys found on the top row of a QWERTY keyboard. The top row contains the letters q, w, e, r, t, y, u, i, o, and p. Notice that the letters 'a', 'y', 'k', 'n', 'e', 't', and 'l' are not present on the top row.

Would 1996 leap year baby technically be 1 year old in 2000?,"['A leap year happens once every 4 years and has 29 days in February.', 'The years 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 are the last 7 leap years that have happened.', '1996 to 2000 is one leap year.']","First, we establish that 1996 was a leap year with 29 days in February. A leap year baby born in 1996 would have their first birthday on February 29, 1997, which is also a leap year. Since there is no February 29 in 1998, 1999, or 2000, the baby would not have a birthday in those years. However, they would still be considered 1 year old throughout 2000 until their next leap year birthday on February 29, 2004. The answer is 'True'.",True

Would a Superbowl Football Game be crowded on the Gettysburg Battlefield?,"['Football fields used in the Super Bowl are 100 yards long. ', 'The Gettysburg Battlefield is over 5 miles long.', 'There are 1760 yards in a mile.']","First, calculate the total area of a Superbowl football field in yards: 100 yards long * 53.3 yards wide (standard width) = 5330 square yards.
Next, convert the length of the Gettysburg Battlefield from miles to yards: 5 miles * 1760 yards/mile = 8800 yards.
Assuming the battlefield is roughly rectangular and has an area large enough to accommodate multiple football fields, we can estimate the number of football fields that would fit within the area of the battlefield by dividing the total area of the battlefield by the area of a single football field: 8800 yards * 1760 yards/mile / 5330 square yards = approximately 270 football fields.
Given the vast size of the Gettysburg Battlefield compared to a single football field, it would not be crowded if a Superbowl football game were held there. The answer is 'False'.",False

Can an American black bear swallow a sun bear whole?,"['Sun bears grow to only about half the size of an American black bear.', 'The total length of adult bear skulls was found to average 262 to 317 mm (10.3 to 12.5 in).', 'Black bears cannot open their mouths to half their body length.']","First, consider the size difference between the two bear species: Sun bears are about half the size of American black bears. Next, look at the average skull length of adult bears, which is given as 262 to 317 mm (10.3 to 12.5 in). While this measurement does not directly correspond to the maximum gape or mouth width, it provides a reference point for the size of a bear's head. The context also states that black bears cannot open their mouths to half their body length.

Assuming the mouth width is roughly proportional to the skull length, and given that a black bear's head is significantly larger than a sun bear's, it is still unlikely that an American black bear could open its mouth wide enough to swallow a sun bear whole, considering the constraints of its skull and jaw structure.

Can Darth Vader hypothetically outdunk Bill Walton without using The Force?,"['The Force allows a Jedi to move objects with their mind.', 'Darth Vader is 6\'2"" tall.', 'Former basketball player Bill Walton is a towering 6\'11"" tall.', 'The NBA basketball rim is 10 feet high.']","First, consider the heights of Darth Vader and Bill Walton: Vader is 6'2"" tall, while Walton is 6'11"" tall. Given that the NBA basketball rim is 10 feet high, a player of Walton's height would have a significant advantage in dunking a basketball compared to someone of Vader's height. Without using The Force, which allows movement of objects with the mind and is not a physical attribute related to basketball skills, Darth Vader would not have the natural height or reach to outdunk Bill Walton.

', 'Someone with a nosebleed would want the bleeding to stop.']","First, understand that coca has the property of constricting blood vessels. This action can help stop bleeding because it reduces blood flow to the affected area. A person with a nosebleed would indeed want the bleeding to stop in order to prevent further discomfort and potential complications. Given that coca's血管收缩作用 can help止血, it stands to reason that it could be beneficial in stopping a nosebleed.

Were Walkman's used in the Kingdom of Hungary?,"['The Kingdom of Hungary ended in 1946. ', 'The Walkman was invented in 1979.']","The Kingdom of Hungary ended in 1946, while the Walkman was invented in 1979. Since the Walkman was created after the kingdom had ceased to exist, Walkmen were not used during the time of the Kingdom of Hungary. The answer is 'False'.",False
Will Communion be denied to Wednesday name origin followers?,"['Communion is the body and blood of Christ given out during mass.', 'Communion is only given to believers baptized in the Christian Church.', 'Wednesday comes from Old English Wodnesdaeg referring to Woden, also called Odin.', 'Odin was the pagan god of Norse mythology.', 'Vikings, believers in Norse mythology, clashed with Christians in Wessex and Northumbria for hundreds of years.']","First, understand the requirements for receiving Communion: it is given to baptized believers in the Christian Church. Next, consider the context of Wednesday's name origin, which is derived from Woden (Odin), a pagan god in Norse mythology. Vikings, who followed this mythology, had conflicts with Christians historically. However, this historical context does not dictate current church practices. Current church practices do not deny Communion based on one's name origin or historical ancestry but on their belief in Christianity and having received baptism. The answer is 'False'.",True

Would a veteran of the Phillippine-American War come home craving SPAM?,"['War veterans are often used to the rations they eat during war and crave similar items at home.', 'The Philippine-American war took place before World War II, in 1899.', 'Soldiers in World War II were given SPAM in their rations. ', 'SPAM was released in 1937.']","First, consider the time periods of the Philippine-American War and the introduction of SPAM: The Philippine-American War took place from 1899 to 1902, while SPAM was released in 1937. Therefore, soldiers during the Philippine-American War would not have had access to SPAM during their time in service.
Second, consider the likelihood of veterans craving rations from their time in war: It is true that war veterans can develop a taste for the rations they consumed during their service, as they are accustomed to those foods.
However, since SPAM was not available until long after the Philippine-American War, it is unlikely that veterans of that conflict would have been exposed to it or developed a craving for it.

Could Moulin Rouge have been hypothetically used as Spain's Spanish American War triage center?,"['The Moulin Rouge cabaret in France had a capacity of 850 people.', 'Spain had 700-800 injured during Spanish American War.']","First, consider the capacity of the Moulin Rouge cabaret, which is 850 people. Next, consider the number of injured Spanish soldiers during the Spanish American War, which was approximately 700-800. While the Moulin Rouge's capacity is close to the number of injured soldiers, it is important to note that it is a cabaret and not a medical facility designed for triage or treatment of war injuries. Additionally, the Moulin Rouge is located in France, not in a location directly involved in the Spanish American War.

The answer is 'False', as the Moulin Rouge, being a non-medical entertainment venue and geographically distant from the conflict, would not have been suitable or practical as a triage center for Spanish American War casualties.",True
Would a baby gray whale fit in a tractor-trailer?,"['Gray whales measure 4.9 m (16 ft) in length for newborns.', 'A semi-trailer is 48 feet long.']","First, consider the length of a newborn gray whale: they measure 4.9 meters (16 feet) in length.

Did Metallica band members cutting their hair hurt their sales?,"['Metallica famously cut their hair in 1996 which caused a huge divide in their fanbase.', ""Metallica's best selling album, The Black Album, was released in 1991 and has sold over 20 million copies."", 'Since 1996, Metallica have released 5 studio albums.', ""Metalica's 5 studio albums since 1996 have sold around a combined 14 million copies""]","First, we establish that Metallica's best-selling album, The Black Album, was released before the band members cut their hair in 1996. Next, we note that the band's sales after 1996, when they had cut their hair, amounted to approximately 14 million copies combined over five studio albums. 

To determine if cutting their hair hurt their sales, we would compare the sales of their albums before and after the haircut. The Black Album alone sold over 20 million copies, which is more than the combined sales of the five albums released after 1996. However, this comparison does not account for factors other than the change in appearance, such as changes in music style, market conditions, or general shifts in popularity.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude that cutting their hair directly hurt their sales. The comparison of album sales alone does suggest a decrease in sales volume post-1996, but other factors could have contributed to this change. The answer is 'Insufficient information'.",True
Can a goat be used for one of the ingredients in French toast?,"['French toast is made from bread, eggs, milk, and cinnamon.', 'Goats are able to produce milk, similar to cows.', 'Goats milk is used in a variety of cheeses and milks sold in super markets.']","First, identify the ingredients required for French toast: bread, eggs, milk, and cinnamon. Next, consider the context about goats: they produce milk, which is used in various dairy products like cheese and milk sold in supermarkets. Given that milk is an ingredient in French toast, and goats can produce milk, it is possible to use goat milk as a substitute for cow's milk in French toast. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can you measure a Caracal with a protractor?,"['A caracal is a small wild cat', 'Cats and other animals are measured in terms of properties like length, width, and weight', 'Protractors measure angles']","First, consider the purpose of a protractor: it is a tool used to measure angles. Next, consider what properties are typically measured for cats and other animals: length, width, and weight. A protractor would not be an appropriate tool to measure these properties. A caracal, being a cat, would also be measured in terms of length, width, and weight, not angles. Therefore, a protractor cannot be used to measure a caracal. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could the endowment of Johns Hopkins University pay off the MBTA debt?,"['Johns Hopkins University had an endowment of $6.28 billion in 2019.', 'The MBTA is in debt for approximately $9 billion.']","First, compare the size of Johns Hopkins University's endowment to the MBTA's debt: the endowment is $6.28 billion, while the debt is approximately $9 billion. Since the endowment is less than the debt, the endowment would not be sufficient to pay off the entire MBTA debt. The answer is 'False'.",False

The protagonist is Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne. Next, consider the context about the sagas, which are Nordic mythological stories celebrated by the Vikings. Then, recall that Charlemagne, and by extension Roland, was the leader of the Franks who had numerous conflicts with the Vikings, including the Siege of Paris in 845 AD. Given this historical context, it is unlikely that Roland or the Franks would have had a friendly relationship with the Vikings, who were their enemies.

Did Dr. Seuss make himself famous?,"[""Dr. Seuss's wife was Helen Palmer."", 'Helen Palmer suggested that Dr. Seuss become an artist rather than a professor.', ""Helen Palmer inspired much of Dr. Seuss's work.""]","First, note that the context provided does not directly discuss how Dr. Seuss became famous but rather mentions his wife Helen Palmer's influence on his career and work. Helen Palmer suggested that he pursue a career in art and was an inspiration for his writing. However, fame is typically the result of one's work being widely recognized and appreciated by the public.

While Helen Palmer may have played a significant role in supporting and inspiring Dr. Seuss, it was ultimately his creative works, such as his children's books, that gained popularity and made him famous. Therefore, it is Dr. Seuss's own artistic output and its reception by the public, rather than just his wife's suggestion, that led to his fame.

The answer is 'True', but with the understanding that while Helen Palmer's encouragement was influential, it was Dr. Seuss's own creative efforts that ultimately made him famous.",False

If the bee survives the encounter, it no longer has a stinger to sting another person. Therefore, a single honey bee typically cannot sting multiple humans because it loses its stinger in the process.

The first Godzilla film was released in 1954. Works that are significantly old eventually enter the public domain, meaning they can be used without copyright permission. Godzilla will enter the public domain in the year 2049, which means that in 2050, it would have already transitioned into the public domain. Therefore, in 2050, Godzilla's image would not be grounds for a lawsuit as it would no longer be protected by copyright. The answer is 'False'.",False

Will silicon wedding rings outsell bromine wedding rings?,"['Wedding rings are typically made of precious shiny stones such as diamonds.', 'Silicon is a solid rock like element at room temperature that has a natural lustre.', 'Bromine is a liquid at room temperature that is toxic to the touch.']","First, consider the traditional materials used for wedding rings, which are typically precious shiny stones like diamonds. Silicon, while a solid element with a natural lustre, is not a conventional choice for jewelry. On the other hand, bromine is a toxic liquid, making it an impractical and unsafe option for a wearable item like a wedding ring.

Given these considerations, it is highly unlikely that people would choose silicon or bromine for their wedding rings due to tradition and safety concerns. Wedding rings made of more conventional materials, like gold, silver, or platinum, would likely outsell any unconventional materials like silicon or bromine.

Was Moliere Queen Margot's ill fated lover?,"[""Queen Margot is a character in Alexande Dumas's La Reine Margot."", 'Queen Margot keeps the head of her executed lover.', ""Joseph Boniface de La Môle, nicknamed La Mole, was executed as a conspirator against Queen Margot's kingdom."", ""Queen Margot is set during the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre which occurred in 1572."", 'Moliere was born in 1622.']","First, identify the relevant information: Queen Margot is a fictional character from a novel by Alexandre Dumas, and Moliere was a real person who lived in a different time period. Moliere was born in 1622, while the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, which serves as the historical backdrop for Queen Margot, occurred in 1572. Given that Moliere was born 50 years after the events of the novel, it is impossible for him to have been Queen Margot's lover.

', 'Lionel Richie finally turned to a holistic doctor who said that the problem was simply acid reflux caused by foods he was eating before going to bed.']","First, we learn that Lionel Richie had throat problems and sought conventional medical help, but the situation didn't improve. Then, he turned to a holistic doctor who provided a different diagnosis. This suggests that Lionel Richie was open to exploring alternative approaches to medicine when conventional methods didn't work for him. The answer is 'True'.",True
Was The Canterbury Tales written before One Thousand and One Nights?,"['One Thousand and One Nights was compiled during the Islamic Golden Age.', 'The Islamic Golden Age lasted from 800 AD to 1258 AD.', 'The Canterbury Tales was written in 1392.']","First, establish the time frame of the Islamic Golden Age, which according to the context, lasted from 800 AD to 1258 AD. Next, consider the year The Canterbury Tales was written, which is given as 1392. Since 1392 comes after the end of the Islamic Golden Age, and One Thousand and One Nights was compiled during that period, The Canterbury Tales was written after One Thousand and One Nights. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is the Fibonacci number sequence longer than every number discovered in Pi?,"['The Fibonaacci number is a sequence of numbers that adds a number to the one before it and goes on forever.', 'Pi is a sequence of numbers and 2.7 trillion digits were discovered in 2010.']","First, understand that the Fibonacci sequence is infinite, as it adds each number to the previous one without end. In contrast, Pi, although it has an infinite number of decimal places, has a finite known number of digits that have been calculated, which was 2.7 trillion as of 2010. Since the Fibonacci sequence continues indefinitely and there is a finite known number of digits in Pi, the Fibonacci sequence is longer than the number of digits discovered in Pi up to that point.

', 'Additionally, you will sweat and roll around on a shared mat when practicing judo.']","First, understand that germaphobia involves an intense fear of germs and contamination. Second, consider the nature of Judo practice, which involves close physical contact with training partners and rolling on shared mats, which can lead to sweat and potential exposure to germs. Given the nature of germaphobia, it is likely that an individual with this condition would find it difficult or distressing to participate in Judo due to the unavoidable close contact and risk of contamination.

Were the first missionaries required to attend mass on Sundays?,"['The word ""mission"" originates from 1598 when the Jesuits sent members abroad.', 'Jesuits are a Roman Catholic order of religious men', 'The Roman Catholic religion requires members to attend mass on Sundays']","First, understand the context: the term ""mission"" started in 1598 with the Jesuits, who are part of the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has a rule that its members must attend mass on Sundays. Since the Jesuits are part of the Catholic Church and the mission concept emerged from their activities, it is logical to assume that those early missionaries, being Jesuits, would have been required to follow the religious practices of the Church, including attending mass on Sundays.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Can an ostrich fit into the nest of a swallow?,"['Swallows weigh less than an ounce.', 'An ostrich can weigh over 200 pounds.']","First, consider the sizes of the two birds: swallows are very small birds, weighing less than an ounce, while ostriches are the largest birds in the world, weighing over 200 pounds. Given these significant size differences, it is physically impossible for an ostrich to fit into the nest of a swallow, which is designed for a much smaller bird. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Wednesday have something to do with Thor?,"['Wednesday is the middle of the modern work week and comes from the name Wodan.', 'The Germanic god Woden is also known as Wodanaz or Odin.', 'Odin, in Norse mythology, was the father of Thor.']","First, understand the connection between Wednesday and Wodan: Wednesday is derived from the name Wodan, a Germanic god. Next, recognize the relationship between Woden and Odin: they are the same deity, known by different names. Finally, consider the context of Norse mythology: Odin is indeed the father of Thor. Given this information, Wednesday's name has a historical connection to Thor through their shared association with the Germanic god Woden/Odin. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would an Olympic athlete be tired out after running a mile?,"['The Olympic standard for men in running one mile is 4 minutes, 19 seconds. ', 'The Olympic standard for women in running one mile is at least 4 minutes and 40 seconds. ']","First, consider the Olympic standards for running a mile: men's is 4 minutes, 19 seconds, and women's is at least 4 minutes and 40 seconds. These times indicate elite performance by highly trained athletes. Running at such a fast pace would be taxing on the body, even for an Olympic athlete.

However, Olympic athletes are conditioned to perform at these speeds and typically recover relatively quickly from such efforts. While they might experience some short-term fatigue, it is unlikely that they would be completely ""tired out"" after running a single mile at their Olympic standard, as this is within their normal training range.

The answer is 'False', as an Olympic athlete would not necessarily be tired out after running a mile at their Olympic standard, given their high level of physical fitness and training.",False
Would the current president of Ohio University hypothetically wear a jockstrap?,"['The current president of Ohio University is Duane Nellis.', 'Duane Nellis is a man.', 'A jockstrap is an undergarment for protecting the testes and penis during cycling, contact sports or other vigorous physical activity.', 'The testes and penis are the sexual organs of men.']","First, identify the subject in question: Duane Nellis, the current president of Ohio University, who is a man. Next, understand the purpose of a jockstrap: it is designed to protect the testes and penis during physical activities. Since men have testes and a penis, it is plausible that they might wear a jockstrap for protective purposes during certain activities. However, the context does not specify if President Nellis engages in activities that would require a jockstrap. The question is more of a hypothetical scenario rather than a definitive statement about his actual practices.

The answer is 'True' in the sense that it is physically possible for him to wear one if needed, but 'False' in the sense that we don't have information to confirm if he actually does so in his personal life. Given the ambiguity, the most appropriate answer would be 'Insufficient information to determine'.",True
Is Autumn a good time to collect bear pelts in US?,"['Autumn runs from September to the end of December in the US.', 'Bears go into hibernation from September through April and are scarcely seen.']","First, note the time frame for autumn in the US (September to the end of December). Next, consider the hibernation period of bears, which runs from September through April. During hibernation, bears are not active and are difficult to find. Therefore, it would not be a good time to collect bear pelts in the US during autumn, as the bears are likely to be in hibernation and not available. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, note the location of Mount Sharp: it is on Mars. The atmosphere of Mars is known to have only trace amounts of oxygen, which is insufficient for most Earth-based life forms, including animals like mountain goats. Therefore, mountain goats cannot inhabit the summit of Mount Sharp due to the lack of breathable oxygen. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could Larry King's marriages be counted on two feet?,"['The typical person has 10 toes spread across their two feet.', 'Larry King has been married 8 times.', 'You can count each marriage on each toe.']","First, consider the number of marriages Larry King has had, which is 8. Next, recognize that the context mentions that one can count each marriage on a toe, and a typical person has 10 toes on two feet. Since 8 marriages is fewer than the 10 toes available to count them, it is possible to count Larry King's marriages using just his two feet.

Does Rupert Murdoch's alma mater have more history than the USA?,"[""Rupert Murdoch's alma mater is Worcester College."", 'Worcester College was founded in 1714.', 'The first documented use of the term the United States of America was in a January 2, 1776 letter.']","First, identify the key points from the context: Worcester College, founded in 1714, is Rupert Murdoch's alma mater. The term ""United States of America"" was first used in 1776. To determine if Worcester College has more history than the USA, we need to compare the years of their establishment.

Worcester College was founded in 1714, which is before the first documented use of the term ""United States of America"" in 1776. Therefore, Worcester College has a longer history than the concept of the United States as a nation.

Will AC/DC album sales buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's?,"['The B-52 bomber plane cost 60 million dollars in 2018.', 'AC/DC has sold over 200 million albums.', 'Lil Wayne has sold 120 million records worldwide.']","First, calculate the total revenue from AC/DC album sales by multiplying the number of albums sold by the average price of an album. However, since the exact price per album is not provided, we can make a rough estimate. Assuming an average price of $10 per album (this is a low estimate considering albums can cost more, especially when accounting for special editions and concerts), AC/DC's revenue would be 200 million * $10 = $2 billion.

Next, calculate the total revenue from Lil Wayne's record sales using the same method. Assuming the same average price of $10 per album, Lil Wayne's revenue would be 120 million * $10 = $1.2 billion.

Now, divide the total revenue of each artist by the cost of one B-52 bomber to find out how many bombers each could buy. For AC/DC: $2 billion / $60 million/Bomber = approximately 33.33 bombers. For Lil Wayne: $1.2 billion / $60 million/Bomber = approximately 20 bombers.

Since AC/DC could potentially buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne, the answer is 'True'.",True

Would a caracal be defeated by Javier Sotomayor in a high jump competition?,"['The caracal can leap higher than 12 feet in the air.', ""Javier Sotomayor is the current men's high jump record holder with a jump of 2.45 m (8 ft 1⁄4 in).""]","First, convert the caracal's jump height to the same unit as Javier Sotomayor's record: 12 feet is equal to 3.66 meters.
Next, compare the two heights: the caracal can jump 3.66 meters, while Javier Sotomayor's record is 2.45 meters.
Since the caracal's jump is higher than Sotomayor's record, the caracal would not be defeated by him in a high jump competition.

Can native wolverines be found in Miami?,"['Wolverines are native to northern boreal forests', 'Miami is not a northern boreal habitat']","First, consider the natural habitat of wolverines: they are native to northern boreal forests. Next, note the climate and habitat of Miami: it is not a northern boreal environment, but rather a tropical climate. Since wolverines are not native to non-boreal habitats like Miami, they would not be found there in their natural state. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do moths that live on sloths have family dinners?,"['Algae grows on sloths', 'Sloth moths feed on algae that grows on sloths', 'Sloth moth caterpillars feed on sloth dung ', 'Sloths defecate far from their ususl abode']","First, understand the context: Sloth moths feed on algae that grows on sloths, and their caterpillars feed on sloth dung. Sloths defecate far from their usual abode.

Now, consider the concept of ""family dinners."" Family dinners typically imply a social gathering where members of a family consume a meal together. Moths, being insects, do not have the capacity for social gatherings or organized meals like humans do.

Given this information, it is not accurate to say that sloth moths have family dinners, as their behavior is driven by instinctual feeding patterns rather than social activities. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do the Ubuntu people speak Ubuntu?,"['Ubuntu is a of free and open-source software used on computers.', 'The Ubuntu people are a tribe that lives in Africa.', 'The Ubuntu people derive their language from Nguni Bantu.', 'As of 2019 only 10% of households in Africa have a computer.']","First, identify the subject in question: the ""Ubuntu people"" and their language. Ubuntu, as mentioned in the context, is a software, not a language. The Ubuntu people are a tribe in Africa who speak a language derived from Nguni Bantu. The fact that only 10% of African households have computers in 2019 is unrelated to the language spoken by the Ubuntu people.

Next, consider the religious practice of Jehovah's Witnesses: they abstain from celebrating holidays due to their perceived pagan origins. Finally, note the historical roots of New Year's, which do indeed have connections to pagan Babylonia. Given that New Year's Eve is part of the New Year's celebration and has pagan origins, Jehovah's Witnesses would not celebrate it. The answer is 'True'.",False
Is Kim Kardashian a guru?,"['A guru is a teacher or guide, particularly a spiritual one.', 'Kim Kardashian is a socialite and a model.']","First, understand the definition of a guru: it refers to a teacher or guide, especially in spiritual matters.

Did Thomas Greenhill's parents violate the concept of monogamy?,"['Thomas Greenhill was a surgeon born to William and Elizabeth Greenhill.', 'William and Elizabeth Greenhill had 39 children.', 'Monogamy is a committed relationship between two people where usually they remain together for life.', 'Thomas Greenhill was the last of his parents 39 children and was born shortly after his father died.']","First, understand the definition of monogamy: it refers to a committed relationship between two people, typically lasting for life, in which each partner is exclusive to the other. Context states that William and Elizabeth Greenhill had 39 children together. Since they had these children within the context of their relationship, and there is no information suggesting they had other partners, it can be inferred that they were in a monogamous relationship. The fact that Thomas Greenhill was born last, after his father's death, does not change the nature of the relationship while both parents were alive. Therefore, William and Elizabeth Greenhill did not violate the concept of monogamy during their lifetimes. The answer is 'False'.",False
Will a Holstein cow and the Liberty Bell balance out a giant scale?,"['The Liberty Bell weighs 2,080 pounds.', 'A mature Holstein cow weighs around 1,500 pounds.']","First, consider the weights of the two objects: the Liberty Bell weighs 2,080 pounds, and a mature Holstein cow weighs around 1,500 pounds.

Is viscosity unimportant in making jello shots?,"['Jello shots are a combination of alcohol and jello to create an edible intoxicant. ', 'If the liquid for the Jello shots has too low a viscosity, it will not become a semi-solid. ']","First, understand the context: Jello shots are made by combining alcohol with jello to form a solid, edible treat. The jello needs to set and hold its shape, which is dependent on the viscosity (thickness) of the liquid mixture.

If the liquid has too low a viscosity, it won't solidify properly, and the jello shots will not have the desired semi-solid texture. Therefore, viscosity is crucial for achieving the correct consistency in jello shots.

Can citrus grow in Ulaanbaatar?,"['Citrus can withstand short periods down to as cold as −10 °C (14 °F), but realistically temperatures not falling below −2 °C (28 °F) are required for successful cultivation.', 'Ulaanbaatar has an average annual temperature of −0.4 °C or 31.3 °F.']","First, consider the temperature requirements for citrus cultivation: citrus can withstand short periods down to −10 °C (14 °F), but ideal conditions require temperatures not falling below −2 °C (28 °F) for successful cultivation. Next, look at the average annual temperature in Ulaanbaatar: it is −0.4 °C or 31.3 °F. This average temperature is close to the threshold where citrus might not survive the cold winters.

However, since the average temperature is above the -2°C threshold and citrus can tolerate short periods below that, it's possible that with proper protection during the coldest nights, citrus could potentially grow in Ulaanbaatar. But given the close margin and potential challenges, it might not be a common or reliable cultivation.

The answer is 'True', but with the understanding that it would be challenging and may require special care and conditions for citrus to grow in Ulaanbaatar.",False
Did Electronic Arts profit from Metroid sales?,"['Metroid was created and published by Nintendo.', 'Electronic Arts is a video game company that is a competitor to Nintendo.', 'Companies cannot profit of the work owned by another company typically.', 'Companies do not typically share profits with their competitors.']","First, understand that Metroid is a video game created and published by Nintendo, not Electronic Arts. Second, recognize that Electronic Arts is a competitor to Nintendo. It is generally typical for companies not to profit from the work owned by another company, especially competitors. Lastly, it is uncommon for companies to share profits with their direct competitors.

Given this context, Electronic Arts would not normally profit from Metroid sales because it is a product of their competitor, Nintendo, and there is no known agreement for profit sharing between the two companies.

Are you likely to hear Rammstein playing in smooth jazz clubs?,"['Smooth jazz is a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&B.', 'Smooth jazz began in the United States in the 1970s.', 'Rammstein is a German band that plays heavy metal music.']","First, consider the genre of music played in smooth jazz clubs: it is a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&B. Rammstein, on the other hand, is a German band known for playing heavy metal music, which is quite different from the smooth jazz genre. Smooth jazz clubs typically cater to a more relaxed and mellow atmosphere, not suited for heavy metal music.

Would a kindergarten teacher make a lesson of the New Testament?,"['The majority of Kindergarten teachers work in public schools.', 'Public schools abide by a separation of church and state, and do not have any overall religion.', 'Students of all religions are welcome to attend public school.']","First, consider the context that public schools in the United States abide by the principle of separation of church and state, which means they do not promote or teach specific religious doctrines. The New Testament is a religious text central to Christianity. Given that kindergarten teachers work in public schools and these schools aim to be inclusive of students from various religious backgrounds, it is unlikely that they would make a lesson specifically focused on the New Testament.

Can a believer in agnosticism become pope?,"['The pope is the head of the Catholic Church.', 'The pope is required to be a devout follower of Christ.', 'Popes preach about the teachings of Christ and the belief in one god.', 'Agnostics do not acknowledge the existence of god and instead state that no one knows if there is a god or not.']","First, understand the requirements for being pope: the pope must be a devout follower of Christ and preach about the teachings of Christ and the belief in one God. Next, consider the definition of agnosticism: agnostics do not acknowledge the existence of God and maintain that it is unknown whether there is a god or not. Since the pope's role requires a firm belief in the existence of God, an agnostic would not meet this requirement. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is most coffee produced South of the Equator?,"['The countries with the highest coffee production are in South America.', 'Almost all of South America is in the Southern Hemisphere.']","First, note that the countries with the highest coffee production are in South America.

Will Ronda Rousey hypothetically defeat X-Men's Colossus in a fight?,"['Ronda Rousey is a mixed martial artist and wrestler.', 'Ronda Rousey relies on striking moves and submission tactics to dominate her opponents.', ""X-Men's Colossus has the ability to change his appearance."", ""Colossus's mutation allows him to create an organic steel layer, that acts as an impenetrable external shell.""]","First, consider Ronda Rousey's skills as a mixed martial artist and wrestler, which primarily involve striking and submission moves. Next, consider Colossus's abilities as a character in the X-Men universe, specifically his mutation that allows him to create an organic steel layer, providing an impenetrable external shell. This shell would likely make him invulnerable to Rousey's striking and submission techniques.

Given that Colossus's steel form would protect him from Rousey's attacks, and assuming Rousey has no means to bypass this defense, she would not be able to defeat him in a fight. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can brewing occur in a prison environment?,"['Pruno is a product made almost exclusively in prisons.', 'Pruno is a fermented beverage that is made of fruit to produce alcohol.']","First, understand that brewing involves the fermentation of sugars to produce alcohol. Context 2 states that Bruno is a fermented beverage made of fruit, which implies that it is produced through a brewing process. Context 1 tells us that Bruno is made almost exclusively in prisons, suggesting that the necessary ingredients and conditions for brewing can be obtained or created within a prison environment.

Given that brewing is the process behind creating Bruno, and Bruno is produced in prisons, it is reasonable to conclude that brewing can occur in a prison environment.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Did Amy Winehouse always perform live perfectly?,"['Amy Winehouse was known for getting intoxicated before an during sets.', 'Amy Winehouse forgot the lyrics to her songs during her last performance.']","First, consider the context: Amy Winehouse was known for getting intoxicated before and during her sets, which could potentially affect her performance. Additionally, there is a specific instance mentioned where she forgot the lyrics to her songs during her last performance. This indicates that her live performances were not consistently perfect due to issues with intoxication and忘词. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do American wheelchair users know what the ADA is?,"['The ADA is the Americans with Disabilities Act.', 'Non-ADA compliant businesses include those without wheelchair access points.']","First, understand that the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) is a law in the United States designed to provide equal opportunities and protection against discrimination for individuals with disabilities. It includes requirements for accessibility in public spaces and businesses.

Context 2 indicates that non-compliance with the ADA can manifest as a lack of wheelchair access points, which directly affects wheelchair users.

Given that the ADA is a law specifically aimed at improving the lives of people with disabilities, including wheelchair users, it is reasonable to assume that American wheelchair users would be aware of the law and its provisions to ensure their accessibility and rights are protected.

Can French Toast hypothetically kill a Lannister?,"[""The Lannister's are a wealthy family in the Song of Ice and Fire book series."", 'French Toast is made from bread dipped in an egg batter.', 'Salmonella is a deadly bacteria that can be carried by spoiled eggs.']","First, consider the context: French Toast is made by dipping bread in an egg batter, and Salmonella is a deadly bacteria that can be carried by spoiled eggs. If the eggs used to make the French Toast were contaminated with Salmonella, it could potentially cause food poisoning if consumed by a Lannister or anyone else.

Now, assess the likelihood of a Lannister being killed by French Toast contaminated with Salmonella: The Lannisters are a wealthy family, so it's reasonable to assume they have access to quality ingredients and proper food handling practices. However, food poisoning can still occur even with high standards, though it's less likely.

Given that the question is hypothetical and Salmonella poisoning is a real risk associated with spoiled eggs, it's possible, though highly unlikely, for French Toast to cause the death of a Lannister under the right (or rather, wrong) circumstances.

The answer is 'True', but with the understanding that the scenario is highly unlikely in real-world conditions.",True

Next, recall the context from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, where the caterpillar is depicted smoking a pipe. This act of smoking would be in direct contradiction with the religious teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses. Therefore, a Jehovah's Witness would likely not approve of the book due to this portrayal of smoking. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is the tibia required for floor exercises?,"['The tibia is a bone in the lower leg', 'Floor exercises are a program in gymnastics competitions', 'Gymnastics requires use of arms and legs, as well as other parts of the body']","First, understand the context: the tibia is a bone in the lower leg, and floor exercises are a part of gymnastics competitions that involve the use of various body parts, including arms and legs. Since the tibia is a key bone in the lower leg and gymnastics floor exercises typically involve movements that engage the legs, it is logical to conclude that the tibia would be required for these exercises.

Does Santa Claus hypothetically give Joffrey Baratheon presents?,"['Santa Claus is a figure in folklore that gives good children presents and bad children coal.', 'Joffrey Baratheon is a character in the Game of Thrones TV series.', ""Joffrey is a young royal that has a man's tongue cut out."", 'Joffrey shoots his crossbow into the flesh of innocent people for his amusement.']","First, consider the criteria for Santa Claus' gift-giving: he gives presents to good children and coal to bad children. Next, evaluate Joffrey Baratheon's behavior based on the provided context: he is shown to be残忍 (cutting a man's tongue out) and sadistic (shooting innocent people for amusement). These actions would typically be considered ""bad"" by the standards of Santa Claus's judgment. Therefore, Joffrey Baratheon would likely receive coal from Santa Claus if he were a part of the folklore's world. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Atari Landfill story an urban legend?,"['An urban legend is a humorous or horrifying story based on hearsay that is circulated as true.', 'E.T. the Extra Terrestrial was panned as one of the worst video games ever made.', 'A widespread story stated that thousands of copies of E.T. the Extra Terrestrial video game were buried in a landfill', 'A former Atari manager stated that 728,000 Atari games were in fact buried in a landfill.', 'The Atari landfill was dug up and nearly 900 games were recovered, but there was only one copy of E.T. included.']","First, consider the definition of an urban legend: a story based on hearsay that is circulated as true. The story of the E.T. the Extra Terrestrial video games being buried in a landfill fits this description. Next, note that the game was indeed panned as one of the worst ever made, which could have contributed to the creation and spread of the legend. A former Atari manager confirmed that a large number of Atari games were buried, providing some basis in reality for the claim. However, when the landfill was excavated, only a small number of games were found, and only one copy of E.T. was discovered, which contradicts the widespread story of thousands being buried.

Given that the legend contains some elements of truth (the burial of Atari games) but deviates significantly in the details (the specific game and the quantity buried), it can be concluded that the E.T. the Extra Terrestrial Atari Landfill story is primarily an urban legend with a kernel of truth.

Since Christmas trees are pine trees and pine trees are evergreen, they are not deciduous. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would John the Baptist be invited to a hypothetical cephalophore reunion in heaven?,"['John the Baptist was a preacher that became a Catholic Saint.', 'John the Baptist was beheaded by king Herod.', 'A cephalophore is a Saint martyred by beheading, and is depicted in art as carrying their own head.', 'Saint Denis was one of several beheaded saints that is said to have carried his own head and is depicted as such in art.', ""John the Baptist did not carry his head, since it was on a plate owned by King Herod's stepdaughter.""]","First, we establish that John the Baptist is a Catholic Saint, which means he might be part of a hypothetical gathering of saints in heaven. Next, we consider the definition of a cephalophore: a saint martyred by beheading who is depicted in art as carrying their own head. John the Baptist was beheaded, but unlike other cephalophores, he did not carry his own head since it was on a plate owned by King Herod's stepdaughter.

Given that the cephalophore distinction is based on the act of carrying one's own head, which John the Baptist did not do, he would not fit the specific criteria for being considered a cephalophore. Therefore, he would not be invited to a hypothetical cephalophore reunion in heaven based on that characteristic.

Do Chinese Americans face discrimination at a Federal level in the US?,"[""The President of the United States frequently referred to the COVID-19 pandemic as a 'Chinese Virus' and 'Kung Flu', encouraging the use of derogatory language towards Chinese Americans."", 'The President of the United States has not called for the violence and hate towards Chinese Americans in response to COVID-19 to end.']","First, consider the context provided: the President of the United States used derogatory language referring to the COVID-19 pandemic as originating from China, which could contribute to a negative atmosphere towards Chinese Americans. Although the President has not explicitly called for violence, his language may have indirectly encouraged a hostile environment.

Second, consider that at the Federal level, policies and actions are often influenced by the tone set by the highest office. The President's words can shape public discourse and potentially influence how government agencies and officials interact with Chinese Americans.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that Chinese Americans may face an increased risk of discrimination at the Federal level due to the President's language, even if there haven't been explicit calls for violence to end. The answer is 'True'.",True

Next, compare this to the size of Mercury, the smallest planet, which has a radius of 1,516 miles. If asteroids are miniature planets, they could be similar in size or even larger than Mercury.

Now, consider the size of New York City, which is 13.4 miles long and 2.3 miles wide. If an asteroid were as large or larger than Mercury, it would be significantly bigger than New York City.

Finally, the weight of Mercury is provided as 3.285 × 10^23 kg, which gives us an idea of the potential energy an asteroid of that size could unleash upon impact. Given the massive size and weight of large asteroids compared to New York City, it is reasonable to assume that such an asteroid could indeed crush a whole city.

Commodus was Roman Emperor until 192 AD, while the Pound sterling has its origins in the fifth century AD. This means that the Pound sterling did not exist during Commodus' time as emperor.

Did the confederate states speak Old English before the Civil War?,"['Old English is the earliest form of English during the middle ages.', 'Modern English replaced old English during the seventeenth century.', 'American English was created and spoken during the formation of the first US colonies. ', 'The civil war started in 1861, and was a war between the northern states and southern states. ']","First, understand the time periods of Old English and the American Civil War. Old English was spoken during the Middle Ages, while Modern English replaced Old English in the 17th century. The American English dialect developed during the formation of the first US colonies, which predates the Civil War. The Civil War started in 1861.

Since the American colonies adopted Modern English, not Old English, by the time of their formation, and the Civil War took place after Modern English had already replaced Old English, it is accurate to say that the Confederate States did not speak Old English before the Civil War.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Ivan the Terrible's father and grandfather have nicer nicknames?,"['Ivan the Terrible was nicknamed terrible because of his harsh rule.', ""Ivan the Terrible's father, Vasili III Ivanovich, was nicknamed Vasili the Adequate."", ""Ivan the Terrible's grandfather, Ivan III Vasilyevich, was nicknamed Ivan the Great.""]","First, consider the nicknames of Ivan the Terrible's father and grandfather: Vasili III Ivanovich was called Vasili the Adequate, and Ivan III Vasilyevich was known as Ivan the Great. Comparing these to Ivan the Terrible's nickname, which is associated with his harsh rule, it seems that both his father's and grandfather's nicknames have a more positive connotation. The terms ""adequate"" and ""great"" generally carry a more favorable meaning than ""terrible."" Therefore, it can be concluded that Ivan the Terrible's father and grandfather had indeed had nicer nicknames than he did. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is a paleo dieter unlikely to color beverages green for St. Patrick's Day?,"['There is no natural source for green food coloring approved by the FDA', 'A paleo diet avoids artificial colors and flavors']","First, consider the guidelines of a paleo diet, which avoids artificial colors and flavors. Next, note that there is no natural source for green food coloring that is approved by the FDA, implying that green food coloring typically used in beverages for St. Patrick's Day is artificial. Given that a paleo dieter would avoid artificial colors like the green food coloring used for St. Patrick's Day beverages, it is unlikely that they would color their beverages green for this occasion.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Does Woody Allen await the Second Coming?,"['The Second Coming refers to Jesus Christ returning to earth', 'Christians and Muslims believe in Jesus Christ', 'Woody Allen is Jewish']","First, understand the context: The Second Coming refers to the return of Jesus Christ to Earth, which is a central belief in Christianity and Islam. Woody Allen is Jewish, and Judaism does not generally include the belief in the Second Coming as a central tenet. Therefore, it is unlikely that Woody Allen, as a Jew, would be awaiting the Second Coming from a religious perspective.

Do you need a large room if you want to get into 3D printing?,"['Home 3D printers are sized to be able to sit on a desk or table.', 'The accessories and materials needed for 3D Printers can be stored easily and efficiently in a box or tote.']","First, consider the size of home 3D printers, which are designed to be placed on a desk or table, indicating they are relatively compact. Second, note that the accessories and materials needed for 3D printing can be stored efficiently in a box or tote, suggesting that the storage requirements are not extensive.

Given this information, you do not need a large room to accommodate a 3D printer and its associated equipment. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can French Defence initial move defend against four move checkmate?,"['The French Defence involves moving pawn in front of the queen forward two spaces.', 'The four move checkmate involves moving the queen and bishop to crowd the king.', 'The four move checkmate cannot be defended by pawn in front of queen.']","First, understand the French Defence strategy: it involves moving the pawn in front of the queen forward two spaces (e4). The four move checkmate, also known as the "" Scholar's Mate,"" is a quick checkmate that can occur in four moves, typically involving the queen and bishop working together to crowd the opponent's king. The context states that this specific checkmate cannot be defended by simply moving the pawn in front of the queen.

Given that the French Defence's initial move does not directly address the specific threats posed by the four move checkmate, and since the context specifies that the pawn move alone is insufficient to defend against it, the French Defence initial move alone would not be enough to defend against the four move checkmate.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Could Intel products be purchased at McDonald's?,"['Intel is a technology company that produces computer products such as processors, chipsets, and GPUs.', ""McDonald's is a fast food franchise that sells food and beverage products.""]","First, consider the nature of the products each company offers: Intel produces technology products, while McDonald's sells food and beverages. These are two completely different industries with distinct product offerings. McDonald's does not carry or sell Intel products, as they are not related to their business. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do Shinto practitioners keep to a kosher diet?,"['Shinto is a religion originating from Japan.', 'Shinto does not have any dietary restrictions.', 'Seafood including shellfish is a staple of the Japanese diet.', 'Jewish kosher laws prohibit the consumption of shellfish.']","First, note that Shinto is a religion from Japan, and it does not have any specific dietary restrictions mentioned in the context. Jewish kosher laws, on the other hand, do prohibit the consumption of shellfish. Since Shinto practitioners are not bound by Jewish dietary laws, they are not required to follow kosher guidelines. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do you have to pass through circle of lust to find Saladin in Dante's Inferno?,"[""Dante's Inferno was a book written by Dante Alighieri that outlines 9 circles of hell."", ""The circle of lust is the second circle in Dante's Inferno."", ""Saladin is placed in the first circle of hell in Dante's Inferno."", 'The first circle of hell is limbo which is reserved for virtuous unbaptized pagans.']","First, we identify the location of Saladin in Dante's Inferno, which is the first circle of hell, also known as Limbo. This circle is for virtuous unbaptized pagans. The question asks if one has to pass through the circle of lust to find Saladin. Since Saladin is in the first circle and the circle of lust is the second circle, one would indeed have to pass through the circle of lust to progress to where Saladin is located. However, it's important to note that in the context of the poem, the journey is a linear one, and passing through the circles sequentially is part of the narrative.

The answer is 'True'.",False
Is the Yellow Pages the fastest way to find a phone number?,"['The Yellow Pages is a book that contains alphabetized phone listings.', 'Yellow pages involves going through many listings and remembering your alphabet.', 'Google allows a person to type in a name quickly and look for a phone number.', 'Household AI assistants like Echo allow people to merely speak a name and ask for number.']","First, consider the methods for finding a phone number: the Yellow Pages involves manually searching through a book, while Google and household AI assistants like Echo allow for quicker search methods through digital platforms. Typing on Google is faster than flipping through pages and remembering alphabet order, and using an AI assistant eliminates the need to type or search manually altogether. Given these comparisons, the Yellow Pages is not the fastest way to find a phone number. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could a hamster experience two leap years?,"['Pet hamsters typically have a maximum lifespan of three years.', 'Leap years are typically separated by four years.']","First, determine the maximum number of years a hamster could live: pet hamsters typically have a maximum lifespan of three years. Next, consider the frequency of leap years: they occur approximately every four years. Since a hamster's maximum lifespan is three years and leap years happen every four years, a hamster would not have enough time to experience two leap years within its lifetime.

The answer is 'False'.",False
Does Alec Baldwin have more children than Clint Eastwood?,"['Alec Baldwin has 5 children as of 2020.', 'Actor Clint Eastwood has 7 children as of 2020.']",The answer is 'False'.,False
Is there a Marvel villain with the same name as a kind of citrus fruit?,"['Mandarins are a type of orange popular in Asian cuisine.', 'The Mandarin is also the name of a villain associated with Iron Man in the Marvel universe.']","First, we identify the two subjects mentioned: mandarins, which are a type of citrus fruit, and Mandarin, a Marvel villain associated with Iron Man. Next, we compare the two names: ""Mandarins"" (the fruit) and ""The Mandarin"" (the villain). Although they have a similar name, one is a plural form and the other is a singular, referring to a specific character. The context confirms that ""The Mandarin"" is indeed a Marvel villain. The answer is 'True'.",True
Are there some countries where waiting staff need no tip?,"['In Japan, leaving a tip for a server is considered rude.', 'In Denmark, servers and wait staff are well paid and tipping is very uncommon.']","First, consider the information about Japan: leaving a tip for a server is considered rude there. This implies that tipping is not expected in Japan. Next, consider Denmark: servers and wait staff are well paid, and tipping is very uncommon. This suggests that while not strictly forbidden, tipping is not a common practice in Denmark either.

Based on this context, there are at least some countries, such as Japan and Denmark, where waiting staff typically do not receive tips or where tipping is not customary. The answer is 'True'.",True
Are amoebas safe from breast cancer?,"['Breast cancer is a disease that occurs in the mammary tissues of mammals.', 'Amoebas are single cell organisms that lack mammary tissue.']","First, understand that breast cancer is a disease specific to mammals, which have mammary glands. Amoebas, being single-celled organisms, do not have mammary tissue or any of the complex biological structures associated with mammals. Therefore, amoebas are not susceptible to breast cancer as they do not possess the necessary biological components for the disease to occur.

Are selfies more dangerous than plague in modern times?,"['There are an average of 7 human plague cases reported each year according to the CDC.', 'Selfies have caused people to fall off of cliffs while trying to get the perfect picture.', 'From October 2011 and November 2017, there were 259 selfie deaths in 137 incidents.']","First, consider the average number of human plague cases reported each year, which is 7 according to the CDC. Next, consider the number of selfie-related deaths from October 2011 to November 2017, which was 259. Comparing these two figures, it is clear that the number of selfie-related deaths is significantly higher than the annual number of plague cases. 

Answer: 'True'.",True
Does highest US Court have enough seats for every Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 1952?,"['The highest court in the US is the Supreme Court.', 'There are nine seats on the Supreme Court.', 'There have been fifteen Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom since 1952.']","First, identify the number of seats on the highest US court, which is the Supreme Court, and it has nine seats. Next, consider the number of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom since 1952, which is fifteen. Since there are nine seats and fifteen individuals (Prime Ministers) in question, it is mathematically impossible for each Prime Minister to have their own seat on the Supreme Court. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was Pi an acceptable number of children in 1980s China?,"[""Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to diameter, is equal to 3.14."", ""In the 1980's China instituted a one-child policy."", ""People that violated China's one child policy were fined heavily and some were sterilized.""]","The answer is 'False'. The context provided discusses the one-child policy in China during the 1980s, which means that having more than one child was not acceptable and would result in penalties. The term ""Pi"" is mentioned as a mathematical constant, not as a reference to the number of children. Therefore, the statement about Pi being an acceptable number of children in 1980s China is incorrect.",False
Does Thiago Moises May 13 2020 submission move hypothetically hurt Achilles?,"['Thiago Moises is a mixed martial arts fighter in the UFC.', 'Thiago Moises beat Michael Johnson by a heel hook submission.', 'Greek hero Achilles had one weakness, his heel.']","First, understand the context: Thiago Moises is a UFC fighter who won a match by using a heel hook submission. A heel hook is a submission move in martial arts that targets the opponent's ankle and can cause severe pain and potential injury if executed correctly. Achilles' heel is a famous lore reference to a vulnerable spot in the Greek hero's body.

Given that a heel hook submission targets an opponent's ankle, which is related to the Achilles' heel story due to its historical significance as a vulnerable area, it is reasonable to assume that the move could hypothetically hurt someone's Achilles tendon if executed with sufficient force and technique, as it does target the area around the heel.

The answer is 'True'.",True
Is a cory catfish likely to eat another living fish?,"['The cory catfish is a fish that is described as a bottom feeder.', 'The cory catfish feeds on food located at the bottom of an ocean.', 'Fish cannot live too deep in oceans for very long because of the intense water pressure.', 'The bottom of oceans is populated by algae, coral, and microorganisms.']","First, consider the diet of the cory catfish, which is described as a bottom feeder that feeds on food found at the bottom of an environment. Next, note that the context refers to ""oceans"" even though cory catfish are typically found in freshwater environments like rivers and lakes, not oceans. However, assuming the context is referring to a freshwater environment, it's likely that the bottom would contain algae, coral, and microorganisms, which align with the natural diet of a cory catfish.

However, the context also mentions that fish cannot live too deep in oceans (which is true for ocean environments), but this doesn't apply to the typical habitat of a cory catfish. If we consider the typical freshwater habitat, it's possible for other living fish to be present at the bottom where cory catfish feed.

While cory catfish are generally not known to eat other fish as their primary diet, they may偶尔 eat small, injured, or dead fish if they come across them. Therefore, it's not a common behavior but not impossible for a cory catfish to eat another living fish under specific circumstances.

The answer is 'Somewhat True', considering the context might be slightly off in terms of the natural habitat of cory catfish, but the possibility of them eating another fish under certain conditions still exists.",False
