Although I was nervous about being the only high school student, I stretched myself and learned a lot. Through the seminar, I mastered the basics of reporting and feature writing. The following summer, I took a creative writing workshop and completed several short stories. In my school's creative writing class this year, I am sharing my stories with others and receiving helpful critiques to improve my craft.","['by putting the ideas in chronological order', 'by clearly stating the main idea', 'by reordering sentences to keep related ideas together']",,"The answer is 'by putting the ideas in chronological order', reasoning process step by step:
