Explanation: The statement ""How do I know that Lacey is the most intelligent person in our geometry class?

Explanation: The text demonstrates the logical fallacy of guilt by association because the speaker changes their opinion on the TV show based on the negative association with Philip, assuming that if Philip likes it, the show must not be good. This is not a bandwagon fallacy, as it's not about popularity, and it's not circular reasoning, as the argument does not rely on the claim itself.",2
"Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Since Sophia Browning became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Browning bears sole responsibility for the downtrend.","['bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct', 'false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other']",,"Answer: false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Explanation: The text implies that because Sophia Browning became vice president and student performance declined and teacher morale is down, she is the sole cause of these issues. This is an example of false causation, where it is assumed that because two events occurred together, one must have caused the other.",1
"Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Right after Andrew moved into the apartment, our washing machine broke. He'd better tell us how he broke it.","['false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other', 'hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence']",,"Answer: false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Explanation: The text implies that because Andrew moved into the apartment and the washing machine broke shortly after, Andrew must have caused the washing machine to break. This is an example of false causation, where the assumption is made that because two events occurred in close proximity, one must have caused the other, even without evidence to support this claim.",0

"Which tense does the sentence use?
Mr. Atkinson will deliver the envelope to Trent.","['future tense', 'past tense', 'present tense']",,"Answer: future tense

"Read the following text from a student essay. How can the writer best improve his or her word choice?
If I could invent something, I would create a really nice bicycle. My bike would have a good seat and great tires so that I could ride it anywhere.

I would choose a fun color to reflect my personality. Inventing a new bike would be cool.","['by reducing repetitive language', 'by using more specific language']",,"by using more specific language

Explanation: The writer's description of the bicycle is quite general and could be enhanced by using more specific language to describe the features and benefits of the invention.

The ancient oak tree () under the weight of its own branches.","['cracked', 'slouched']",,"slouched

Explanation: Personification is a figure of speech where non-human objects or entities are given human characteristics.

""Cracked"" does not convey a human action and does not fit the requirement of personification.",1
"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The rising tide () the sandcastle that the children had so carefully crafted.","['washed over', 'gobbled up']",,"gobbled up

Explanation: The phrase ""gobbled up"" is a better choice for personification because it implies that the rising tide is acting like a living creature, consuming the sandcastle. ""Washed over"" is a more literal and less imaginative description of the tide's action.",1

Which online professional profile is more formal?,"['I am a certified college graduate seeking a teaching position.', ""I've got a degree and certification and want to get a job teaching.""]",,"Answer: I am a certified college graduate seeking a teaching position.

Explanation: The first option uses more formal language with phrases like ""certified college graduate"" and ""seeking a teaching position,"" which are more appropriate for a professional profile.

Which is a run-on sentence?,"['Ants attacked our picnic.', 'My ancestors are from Russia, they came here many years ago.']",,"Answer: My ancestors are from Russia, they came here many years ago.

Explanation: A run-on sentence occurs when two or more independent clauses are joined without appropriate punctuation or conjunction.

Which is a complete sentence?,"['Darkness comes quickly on long winter nights.', ""Zoe just moved here she's new to our country.""]",,"Answer: Darkness comes quickly on long winter nights.

Explanation: A complete sentence must have a subject and a predicate. The first option, ""Darkness comes quickly on long winter nights,"" has a clear subject (Darkness) and a predicate (comes quickly on long winter nights).

The first option has two independent clauses (""Bella was stung by a bee"" and ""her finger is slightly swollen"") connected by ""so,"" making it a compound sentence.

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" is vague because it does not clearly refer back to a specific noun.

"What kind of sentence is this?
At the museum, we saw statues from China.","['declarative', 'exclamatory']",,"Answer: declarative

Explanation: The sentence ""At the museum, we saw statues from China"" is a declarative sentence because it makes a statement or declaration about an event or observation. It does not express strong emotion or surprise, which would be characteristic of an exclamatory sentence.",0

Emmet tried to ignore his unfinished essay, but it glared at him from across the room.","[""It bothered Emmet that the essay wasn't finished."", 'Emmet thought he was being watched.']",,"It bothered Emmet that the essay wasn't finished.

Explanation: The personification in the text, where the essay is described as ""glaring"" at Emmet, suggests that the unfinished essay was a source of stress or concern for him, indicating that it bothered him that it wasn't finished. The other option, suggesting that Emmet thought he was being watched, is not supported by the personification of the essay itself.",0
"What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?

Explanation: The correct way to show the title of a book is by using italics or underlining, which is not available in this text format.

Which closing is correct for a letter?,"['Your Student,\nJulia', 'Your student,\nJulia']",,"Your student,\nJulia

Explanation: In formal and semi-formal correspondence, it is customary to use a more personal and respectful closing. The use of ""Your student,"" with the lowercase ""s"" in ""student"" indicates a personal relationship, which is appropriate for a letter where the sender is addressing the recipient in a role-based context, such as a student writing to a teacher or mentor. The capitalization of ""Your Student"" would imply that ""Student"" is part of the sender's name or title, which is not the case here. Therefore, ""Your student,\nJulia"" is the correct choice.",1

"Is there a sentence fragment?
I enjoyed the risotto and the poached pears. Although I didn't care for the seared trout.","['yes', 'no']",,"yes

Explanation: The second part of the sentence, ""Although I didn't care for the seared trout,"" is a sentence fragment because it lacks a complete subject and verb structure. It starts with a conjunction and does not form a complete thought on its own.",0
Which is a run-on sentence?,"['Our cabin has bunk beds for the kids.', 'Our school has rules we always follow them.']",,"Answer: Our school has rules we always follow them.

Explanation: A run-on sentence occurs when two or more independent clauses are joined without appropriate punctuation or conjunction.

I may be blue or black.
What am I?","['a cap', 'a pen']",,"Answer: a pen

Justification: The riddle describes an object that can be held in one's hand, used for writing, and comes in different colors, specifically mentioning blue or black.

Explanation: The second press release is more formal because it uses a more structured and less colloquial language. It uses the full month name ""November"" instead of ""Nov."" and includes the formal title ""Yardley Amphitheater"" instead of just ""the amphitheater."" Additionally, it uses the phrase ""vying for top honors"" which is more formal than ""battle it out.""",1

"Which word would you find on a dictionary page with the following guide words?
mite - mud","['moisture', 'market']",,"Answer: moisture

Explanation: The guide words ""mite"" and ""mud"" suggest a range of words that are related to small creatures or substances.

Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy.
—F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby","['oxymoron', 'anaphora']",,"Answer: oxymoron

Explanation: The phrase ""ferocious delicacy"" is an example of an oxymoron, which is a figure of speech that combines contradictory terms.

Explanation: The text uses circular reasoning because it supports the claim that everyone has their own idea of beauty by stating that it's the individual who determines what's attractive according to their own opinion.

Explanation: The text presents a misrepresentation of Mayor Hoffman's position by suggesting that he is forcing people to give up their cars and bike everywhere, which is not necessarily the case just because he wants to create more bicycle lanes.

Audrey finally found her phone () under the bed.","['missing', 'hiding']",,"Answer: hiding

Explanation: Personification is a figure of speech in which non-human objects or entities are given human characteristics.

Explanation: Personification involves attributing human characteristics to non-human entities.

""Overwhelming"" does not convey the same human-like characteristic and is therefore less suitable for this purpose.",1
Which text message is more formal?,"['Heads up! Schmidt is here. In the lobby.', ""Ms. Schmidt is already here. She's waiting in the lobby.""]",,"Answer: ""Ms. Schmidt is already here. She's waiting in the lobby.""

Explanation: The text presents the idea that if Hazel doesn't attend football games, she has no school spirit.

This is a false dichotomy because it limits the choices to two when there could be other ways to display school spirit.",1
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?,"['When Erica and her sister flew to Hawaii last month, the airline lost her baggage.', ""The airline lost Erica's baggage when she flew to Hawaii with her sister last month.""]",,"When Erica and her sister flew to Hawaii last month, the airline lost her baggage.

Explanation: The text presents a situation where if one does not agree with increasing security guards, they are implied to be planning to steal.

Which is a compound sentence?,"[""Asian pears don't change color after being harvested, but some European pears do."", 'Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes.']",,"Answer: ""Asian pears don't change color after being harvested, but some European pears do.""

Explanation: A compound sentence is one that contains two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (such as ""but""). The first option contains the independent clauses ""Asian pears don't change color after being harvested"" and ""some European pears do,"" joined by ""but,"" making it a compound sentence. The second option is a complex sentence because it contains a main clause (""Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes"") and a dependent clause (not present), but it does not have two independent clauses connected by a conjunction.",0
"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The surfers rode the wave as it () towards the coastline.","['sprinted', 'moved']",,"Answer: sprinted

Explanation: The word ""sprinted"" is a form of personification because it attributes human-like qualities (in this case, the ability to sprint) to a non-human entity (the wave). This makes the sentence more vivid and engaging, as if the wave is actively participating in the action. The word ""moved"" is a more neutral term and does not convey the same level of personification.",0
Which sentence states a fact?,"[""Sheep's wool is used to make all kinds of clothing."", 'The most comfortable clothing is made from wool.']",,"Answer: Sheep's wool is used to make all kinds of clothing.

Explanation: This sentence states a specific fact about the use of sheep's wool in making clothing, which can be objectively verified. The other option is subjective, as comfort is a personal perception and cannot be universally fact-checked.",0
Which correctly shows the title of a movie?,"['In the Blink of an Eye', 'in the blink of an Eye']",,"Answer: In the Blink of an Eye

Which is a simple sentence?,"['The highway is full of cracks, so the workers are repairing it.', 'Tonight the farmers will herd the cattle into the barn.']",,"Answer: Tonight the farmers will herd the cattle into the barn.

Explanation: A simple sentence contains a single independent clause with a subject and a verb. ""Tonight the farmers will herd the cattle into the barn"" is a simple sentence because it has one subject (the farmers) and one verb (will herd). In contrast, ""The highway is full of cracks, so the workers are repairing it"" is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses connected by the conjunction ""so.""",1
"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The car engine () as Mr. Lester tried to start it in the freezing cold.","['failed', 'coughed']",,"coughed

Explanation: Personification is a figure of speech where human qualities are attributed to non-human entities. In this case, ""coughing"" is a human action, and attributing it to the car engine gives the engine a human-like quality, which fits the requirement for personification. ""Failed"" does not convey a human-like action and thus does not fulfill the criteria for personification.",1
"Which figure of speech is used in this text?

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" is vague because it could refer to either Ms. Boone or her daughter.

The second option, ""Later the sailors will wash the deck of the ship,"" is a simple sentence with only one independent clause.",0
Which organizational structure does this text primarily use?,"['cause-effect', 'compare-contrast']","Read the text.
In 1968, when the Democratic Party held its convention in Chicago to select a presidential candidate, the United States was at war in Vietnam. Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process.","cause-effect

Explanation: The text primarily uses a cause-effect organizational structure. It describes a series of events and conditions (causes) such as the war in Vietnam, President Johnson's decision not to run for reelection, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and the exclusion of anti-war protesters from the convention. These causes lead to specific effects, including violent clashes between police and protesters, increased attention to the peace movement, and reforms in the nominating process. The text does not primarily focus on comparing or contrasting different subjects or ideas, which would be characteristic of a compare-contrast structure.",0
Which phrase has a more negative connotation?,"['disagree about something', 'argue about something']",,"Answer: argue about something

Explanation: The phrase ""argue about something"" has a more negative connotation because it implies a more intense or heated disagreement, often involving conflict or contention.

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?,"[""If Steven doesn't know how to make homemade waffles, he can find the recipe in the cookbook."", ""If Steven doesn't know how to make homemade waffles, he can find it in the cookbook.""]",,"Answer: ""If Steven doesn't know how to make homemade waffles, he can find it in the cookbook.""

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" is vague because it does not clearly refer back to a specific noun in the sentence. It could refer to either ""homemade waffles"" or ""the recipe,"" making the reference unclear. In contrast, the first sentence clearly uses ""the recipe"" as the object, making the pronoun reference specific and clear.",1
Which phrase has a more negative connotation?,"['a boring shirt', 'a plain shirt']",,"a boring shirt

Explanation: Both phrases describe a shirt that lacks visual interest, but ""a boring shirt"" implies a stronger negative feeling of disinterest or lack of appeal, whereas ""a plain shirt"" is more neutral, simply stating that the shirt is not decorated or elaborate.",0
Which letter opening is more formal?,"['Dear Mr. McConnell,', 'Dear Eric,']",,"Answer: Dear Mr. McConnell,

Explanation: This sentence is not a run-on sentence. It is a complex sentence that contains a main clause (""Inside its tissues, the spotted jelly grows symbiotic algae"") and a subordinate clause (""that produces food for the jelly and gives it a greenish-brown hue""). The sentence is correctly structured and does not contain any grammatical errors that would classify it as a run-on sentence.",0

Explanation: The text presents a scenario where there are only two choices: raise taxes or condemn schools to failure. This is a false dichotomy because it implies that these are the only two possible outcomes, ignoring the possibility of other solutions or outcomes.",2
"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The tsunami rushed over the land, () everything in its path.","['crashing into', 'devouring']",,"devouring

Explanation: Personification is a figure of speech where non-human objects or forces are given human characteristics.

Which memo to customers is more formal?,"[""Colleen's Cupcakes is committed to your health.

We are honoring that commitment by publishing nutrition information on all of our baked goods.""

Explanation: The first option uses more formal language with phrases like ""committed to your health"" and ""honoring that commitment,"" which makes it more suitable for a formal memo to customers. The second option, while still conveying the same message, uses more casual language (""cares about you"") and is less formal.",0

Explanation: The figure of speech used in the text is anaphora, which is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences.

Explanation: A compound sentence is a sentence that contains two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (such as ""and,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" ""nor,"" ""for,"" ""so,"" ""yet""). In the first option, the clauses ""You can wipe up your spill with some paper towels"" and ""you can use the sponge on the counter"" are joined by the conjunction ""or,"" making it a compound sentence.

Explanation: The personification in the text describes the water as if it has the ability to ""swallow"" parts of the city.

Explanation: The text presents a misrepresentation of Senator Logan's position by suggesting that cutting funding to early childhood education programs is equivalent to hating children. This is a mischaracterization of her actual stance on the issue, which is likely more complex and not solely based on a dislike of children. This misrepresentation makes it easier to argue against her decision by appealing to emotions rather than addressing the actual reasons behind the funding cut.",0
"Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
How do I know that Samantha is the most intelligent person in our geometry class? I know because she's so smart.","['circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself', 'appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good']",,"Answer: circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

"What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
Gary spoke at the city council meeting, claiming the new recycling regulations were draconian.","['a fairy tale', 'Greek history']",,"Answer: Greek history

—Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Identity","['The sea was fierce.', 'The sea was deep in color.']",,"The sea was fierce.

Explanation: The personification in the text, describing the sea as ""angry"" and ""furious,"" suggests that the sea is being portrayed as having intense, aggressive qualities. This implies that the sea is fierce and tumultuous, rather than just describing its color.",0
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?,"[""When Emma parked her scooter next to Mr. Chang's car, she noticed that the scooter had a flat tire."", ""When Emma parked her scooter next to Mr. Chang's car, she noticed that it had a flat tire.""]",,"Answer: ""When Emma parked her scooter next to Mr. Chang's car, she noticed that it had a flat tire.""

Explanation: In the second sentence, the pronoun ""it"" is vague because it could refer to either the scooter or Mr. Chang's car. This ambiguity makes the pronoun reference unclear or vague. In the first sentence, ""she"" clearly refers to Emma, and ""her scooter"" is a clear antecedent for any subsequent pronouns, making the reference specific and not vague.",1
"What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
Yesterday's tennis match was a classic David and Goliath story, with Hanson playing against his former team captain, Ernesto.","['the Bible', 'a poem']",,"Answer: the Bible

The thing that makes Santiago stand out as a remarkable cellist is that he's a marvelous musician who plays the cello splendidly.","['slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences', 'circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself', 'false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other']",,"Answer: circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Explanation: The statement ""The thing that makes Santiago stand out as a remarkable cellist is that he's a marvelous musician who plays the cello splendidly"" is using circular reasoning because it defines Santiago's remarkable cellist status by repeating the same claim (that he is a marvelous musician who plays the cello splendidly), which is essentially the definition of being a remarkable cellist. It does not provide a separate, independent reason or evidence to support the claim.",1
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?,"[""Brian had to stay home with his brother because he wasn't feeling well."", ""Brian's brother wasn't feeling well, so Brian had to stay home with him.""]",,"Answer: ""Brian had to stay home with his brother because he wasn't feeling well.""

walnut - who","['wink', 'weary']",,"Answer: weary

Explanation: In a dictionary, guide words at the top of the page indicate the first and last entries on that page.

Explanation: The text presents a situation where it assumes there are only two possible outcomes: either Leon enjoyed the casserole and asked for a second serving, or he did not enjoy it and did not ask for more.

butter melting on a hot day
mixing sand and water","['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.']",,"Both are only physical changes.

Explanation: The melting of butter is a physical change because it changes from a solid to a liquid state but does not alter its chemical composition.

four tomato plants
four bean plants","Answer: Do the deer eat fewer leaves from bean plants sprayed with garlic spray than from unsprayed bean plants?

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Carla has a garden with bean plants and tomato plants, and she has a garlic spray available. The question that best fits the supplies and the context of her experiment is whether the deer eat fewer leaves from bean plants sprayed with garlic spray than from unsprayed bean plants. This allows her to test the effectiveness of the garlic spray in deterring deer from eating the bean plants. The other options do not align with the supplies she has available (coffee spray and squash plants are not mentioned as available).",1
Assume all other forces on the slice of pizza are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the slice of pizza?,"['The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the slice of pizza.', 'The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza.']",Quinn and Brad are fighting over the last slice of pizza. Quinn is pulling the slice of pizza to the left with a force of 50N. Brad is pulling the slice of pizza to the right with a force of 45N.,"The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza.

Explanation: Since Quinn is pulling with a force of 50N to the left and Brad is pulling with a force of 45N to the right, the forces are not equal and opposite, which means they are unbalanced. The net force is to the left due to Quinn's greater force, and this will cause the slice of pizza to move in that direction.",1

"What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a puddle
dust settling out of the air","['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.']",,"Answer: Both are only physical changes.

Explanation: The evaporation of water from a puddle and the settling of dust out of the air are both physical changes, not chemical changes. Evaporation is a physical change because the water changes state from liquid to gas without altering its chemical composition. Similarly, the settling of dust is a physical change as it involves the movement of particles from one place to another without any change in their chemical properties. Neither of these changes is caused by heating or cooling directly; they are more related to the physical state and movement of the substances involved.",3

But he is also trying to save money.,"Answer: Tyler will give up the chance to go to Alabama. He would have enjoyed a trip to Alabama more than Arkansas.

Explanation: In this context, a cost refers to something that is given up or lost.

Spending more time walking to the grizzly bears, which are on the other side of the zoo, means she will have less time to see other animals before the zoo closes. This is a cost associated with her decision to see the grizzly bears instead of the closer gorillas. The enjoyment she gets from seeing the grizzly bears is a benefit, not a cost.",0
Suppose Richard decides to plant the palm tree. Which result would be a cost?,"['The palm tree will use up more space than the marigolds would have used up.', 'Richard will get to look at the palm tree.

She would have had more fun in the Photography Club than in the Theater Club.

Explanation: In this context, a cost refers to the opportunity cost, which is the value of the next best alternative that must be given up when making a choice. Since Rose believes she would have had more fun in the Photography Club, giving up that opportunity to join the Theater Club represents a cost in terms of enjoyment and satisfaction. The other option, about saving time, is a benefit rather than a cost.",0

Explanation: In the context provided, a cost is something that requires an expenditure or sacrifice.

She wants to make her backyard more beautiful. But she also wants to leave space for doing fun things.,"The maple tree will use up more space than the poppies would have used up.

Explanation: In this context, a cost refers to a sacrifice or something given up. Brittany is considering the space the maple tree will occupy, which is a resource she could use for other activities.

He would have enjoyed seeing them more than the polar bears.']","Eli is deciding whether to see the tamarins or the polar bears at the zoo. He wants to see lots of animals, but the zoo is closing soon.","Answer: Eli will give up the chance to see the tamarins. He would have enjoyed seeing them more than the polar bears.

Explanation: In this context, the cost refers to what Eli has to give up or sacrifice in order to see the polar bears.

But Portugal already controlled sea trade along the West African coast. In fact, the rulers of Spain had signed a treaty agreeing not to trade there.","look for other routes to the Indian Ocean

Explanation: Given the context, the best solution would be to look for other routes to the Indian Ocean. This avoids breaking the treaty and starting a war, which would be expensive and potentially damaging to Spain's reputation and resources. It also allows Spain to continue pursuing its goal of trading in the Indian Ocean without directly challenging Portugal's control over the established route around Africa. Finding alternative routes, such as the one later discovered by Vasco da Gama, would be a strategic and peaceful approach to achieving Spain's trading objectives.",2
