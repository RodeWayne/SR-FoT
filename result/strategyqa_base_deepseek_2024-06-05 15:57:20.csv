Explanation: Based on the context provided, dogs have sensitive ears that can hear as far as a quarter of a mile away, which indicates they have a good sense of hearing. In contrast, grey seals have no ear flaps and their ear canals are filled with wax, which suggests their hearing might be less effective on land. Additionally, grey seals hear better underwater when their ears open like a valve, which is not relevant to hearing a bell on land.

Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?,"['The average cost of a US Boeing 737 plane is 1.6 million dollars.', 'Wonder Woman (2017 film) grossed over 800 million dollars at the box office.']","Answer: True

Justification: The context states that the average cost of a US Boeing 737 plane is 1.6 million dollars, and Wonder Woman (2017 film) grossed over 800 million dollars at the box office.

Justification: 
1. A student born in 1999 would have been 2 years old at the time of the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
2. According to the context, childhood amnesia typically affects memories before the age of 2 or 3.
3. Since the student would have been 2 years old during the 9/11 attacks, they would not likely have amnesia about the event, as they would have been past the age where childhood amnesia typically occurs.",True

', '5-10% of arrests per 100,000 arrests were for  white collar crime according to Department of Justice statistics.', 'Gluttony is the overindulgence in food or similar things.', '39.8% of US adults were classified as overweight according to the National Center for Health Statistics.']","Answer: False

Is average number of peas in a pod enough commas for a billion?,"['The average number of peas in a pod is 6 or 7.', 'A billion is a number that has three commas in it.']","False

Explanation: The average number of peas in a pod (6 or 7) is not enough to represent a billion, which requires three commas in its numerical representation (e.g., 1,000,000,000). The number of peas in a pod does not correlate with the number of commas needed to represent a billion.",True

Does Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday 13th number of projects?,"['Dragon Ball has 6 TV series, 3 TV specials, and 2 direct to video spinoffs as of 2020.', 'Friday the 13th has 12 movies in the franchise and 1 TV series as of 2020.']","Answer: False

- 3 TV specials
- 2 direct to video spinoffs
Total projects for Dragon Ball = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 projects

For Friday the 13th:

Explanation: The Powerpuff Girls are kindergarten-aged girls, which means they are too young to attend Camden Military Academy, which accepts male students in grades 7 through 12. Additionally, the academy is an all-male institution, so even if the Powerpuff Girls were of the appropriate age, they would not be eligible to attend due to their gender.",False

Would a Pict be confused by Old English?,"['Old English was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, a Germanic tribe that inhabited England.', 'The Picts were a Celtic-speaking people that lived in what is now Scotland.', 'The Pictish language died out by 1100AD and was replaced by Gaelic.', 'Gaelic and Old English are completely different languages from different branches of the Indo-European language family.', 'Gaelic vocabulary is very different from Old English  and verbs are also conjugated differently.']","True

Explanation: Given the context, the Picts spoke a Celtic language that was different from Old English, which was a Germanic language. The two languages belonged to different branches of the Indo-European language family and had distinct vocabulary and verb conjugation. Therefore, it is likely that a Pict would be confused by Old English due to the significant differences between the two languages.",True
Would it be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition?,"['The Iwato scale has 5 pitch cases.', 'The chromatic scale has 12 pitch cases.']","Answer: True

Justification: The question asks if it would be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition.

Therefore, it is correct to say that Tom Bergeron, as the host of Dancing With The Stars, is performing double duty.",False
Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?,"['Serfs in Medieval England were peasants that were indentured servants to their lords.', 'Serfs were often harshly treated and had little legal redress against the actions of their lords.', 'Japanese serfs were farmers and fishermen.', 'Japanese believed that serfs produced food, which was depended on by all classes, therefore, they worked harder.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While the context provides information about the roles and treatment of serfs in both Medieval England and Japan, it does not explicitly state that Japanese serfs had a higher status than their English counterparts. The context suggests that Japanese serfs were considered important for producing food, but it does not compare their status or treatment directly with English serfs. Therefore, without clear evidence of higher status for Japanese serfs, the answer is False.",True

Reasoning:
1. An adult Northern fur seal weighs significantly more than an average six-year-old, making it difficult for the child to handle or care for the animal.
2. Northern fur seals have sharp canine teeth, which could pose a risk to a young child.
3. Northern fur seals are wild animals and not typically suited to be domestic pets, especially for a six-year-old.",False

Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?,"['The average weight of a six year old is 45 pounds.', 'One gallon of seawater weighs slightly over 8 pounds.']","False

Explanation: To determine if ten gallons of seawater could crush a six-year-old, we need to calculate the weight of the seawater and compare it to the weight of the child. 

1. The average weight of a six-year-old is 45 pounds.
2. One gallon of seawater weighs slightly over 8 pounds.

Ten gallons of seawater would weigh 10 * 8 = 80 pounds.

Comparing the weight of the seawater (80 pounds) to the weight of the six-year-old (45 pounds), we can see that the seawater is heavier. However, it is not enough to crush the child, as the weight of the seawater is not significantly greater than the child's weight to cause crushing. Therefore, the answer is False.",True

Will Tokyo Tower be repainted only once during President Trump's first term?,"['Tokyo Tower is repainted every five years ', 'The last repainting began in 2018', ""Trump's first presidential term is from 2017 to 2021""]","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context, Tokyo Tower is repainted every five years. The last repainting began in 2018. President Trump's first term was from 2017 to 2021. Since the repainting started in 2018, it would only be completed once during Trump's first term, which ends in 2021. Therefore, the statement is true.",True
Is there a full Neptunian orbit between the first two burials of women in the Panthéon?,"['In 1907, Sophie Berthelot is the first woman to be interred in the Panthéon ', 'In 1995, Marie Curie is the second woman to be interred there', 'Neptune takes 165 years to go around the sun']","Answer: False

Explanation: The first burial of a woman in the Panthéon occurred in 1907, and the second occurred in 1995. To determine if there was a full Neptunian orbit between these two events, we need to calculate the time difference between 1907 and 1995. The time difference is 1995 - 1907 = 88 years. Since Neptune takes 165 years to complete an orbit around the sun, there has not been a full Neptunian orbit between the first two burials of women in the Panthéon. Therefore, the answer is False.",False
Has a neanderthal ever served on the Supreme Court of the United States?,"['The Supreme Court was established in 1789.', 'Neanderthals are primitive humans that lived 40,000 years ago.']","False

Justification: The context states that the American flag has 13 stripes. The question asks if the voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny can each get one stripe from the flag. Since there are only 13 stripes in total, it is not possible for each of the voice actors (13 in total for both characters) to get one stripe. Therefore, the answer is False.",True

Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?,"['The width of the Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet. ', ""A baker's dozen includes 13 items."", 'The width of a Mac truck is around 8 feet.']","False

Explanation: To determine if a baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge, we need to calculate the total width occupied by 13 Mac Trucks and compare it to the bridge's width.

1. A baker's dozen includes 13 items.
2. The width of a Mac truck is around 8 feet.
3. The total width occupied by 13 Mac Trucks would be 13 * 8 = 104 feet.

Comparing this to the width of the Golden Gate Bridge, which is 90 feet:

1. The width of the Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet.

Since 104 feet (the total width of the trucks) is greater than 90 feet (the bridge's width), it would not be possible for 13 side by side Mac Trucks to fit on the bridge without jamming it up. Therefore, the answer is False.",True

Explanation: While the Bombyx mori is famous for its silk production and has been widely used for silk, it does not have a monopoly over silk production.

Explanation: While the New Testament is a central text in Christianity and features angels like Michael and Gabriel, these angels are also mentioned in the Talmud, which is the central text of Rabbinic Judaism. The Talmud names the same four angels (Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael) who are considered archangels.

Explanation: The context states that the Soviet Union received the most gold medals during the 1976 Summer Olympics. However, it also mentions that the Soviet Union existed from 1922 to 1991.

Justification: According to the context, Harry Houdini gave his wife a code word to ask psychics to repeat after his death.

Is polyamory allowed in the Catholic Church?,"['A central tenet of the Catholic Church is a one-to-one match between man and woman.', 'The ten commandments claim that ""coveting your neighbors wife"" is a sin.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, the Catholic Church upholds a one-to-one relationship between a man and a woman as a central tenet. Additionally, the Ten Commandments, which are foundational to Christian teachings, specifically mention that coveting one's neighbor's wife is a sin. This indicates a strict monogamous stance, which contrasts with the concept of polyamory, which involves engaging in multiple romantic or sexual relationships with the consent of all involved parties.

Does a Generation Y member satisfy NYPD police officer age requirement?,"['The NYPD has a minimum age requirement of 21.', 'Members of Generation Y were born between 1980 and 1994.']","Answer: True

Assuming the youngest possible Generation Y member (born in 1994) is applying for the NYPD, they would be at least 27 years old in 2021 (1994 + 27 = 2021).

Explanation: According to the context, King James I wrote Daemonologie, in which he described a fairy as a being that could act as a familiar. A familiar was considered an animal or spirit that conspired with The Devil.

Explanation: While eleventh grade is an educational year in high school and many high schools offer driver's education classes, it is not a requirement to be in eleventh grade to get a driver's license.

Explanation: According to the context provided, Kane (wrestler) did compete in a match at Wrestlemania XXVII in the Georgia Dome, which is located in Atlanta, Georgia, the headquarters city of WCW. Although he wrestled under a different name (Bruiser Mastino) in WCW, his presence in the city for a WWE event suggests that he was not banned from the city itself. Therefore, the statement that Kane was not banned from WCW headquarters city is true.",False
Would multiple average rulers be necessary to measure the length of a giant armadillo?,"['The average ruler is 12 inches or 30 centimeters in length.', 'The typical length of the giant armadillo is 75–100 cm (30–39 in), with the tail adding another 50 cm (20 in).']","False

Explanation: The typical length of the giant armadillo, including its tail, ranges from 125 to 150 cm (49 to 59 in). Given that an average ruler is 30 cm (12 in) in length, a single ruler would not be sufficient to measure the entire length of a giant armadillo. However, multiple average rulers would indeed be necessary to measure the length of a giant armadillo, as the total length exceeds the length of a single ruler. Therefore, the answer is False because the question implies that a single ruler would be enough, which is not the case.",True

Has the Indian Ocean garbage patch not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery?,"['The Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010', 'The Indian Ocean garbage patch takes 6 years to complete a circulation ']","Answer: False

Explanation: The Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010. If it takes 6 years to complete a circulation, then it would have completed two full rotations of debris in 12 years.

Therefore, the statement ""Has the Indian Ocean garbage patch not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery?"" is false.",True
Do some religions look forward to armageddon?,"['Evangelicals cite that we are living in the beginning of Armageddon and that the rapture will happen soon as a good thing.', ""Jehova's Witnesses believe that destroying the present world system and Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity""]","True

Explanation: According to the context, Eomer died at the beginning of The Two Towers, and at that time, Gandalf had already been killed by the Balrog at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring.

Are those incapable of reproduction incapable of parenthood?,"['Surrogates are women who will carry a baby to term for a family seeking to adopt.', 'Many children are put into the adoption and foster system every year and are always available to adopt, independent of the parents reproductive status.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While it is true that those incapable of reproduction cannot biologically have children, they can still become parents through other means such as adoption or surrogacy.

Justification: According to the context provided, keelhauling is considered a form of torture, which is deemed cruel.

Reasoning: The context states that the Herpes simplex virus has a structure of a tiny protein cage and that proteins lose their structure and break down at temperatures above 105.8°F. Since Venus has temperatures reaching 900°F, it is highly unlikely that the Herpes simplex virus could survive and spread on Venus due to the extreme heat causing the proteins to break down.",False
Could Amazon afford The Mona Lisa?,"['Amazon is worth over $1 trillion and had a revenue of $232.887 billion in 2018.', 'The Mona Lisa had an insurance valuation equivalent to $650 million as of 2018.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Amazon, with a worth over $1 trillion and a revenue of $232.887 billion in 2018, could afford to purchase The Mona Lisa, which had an insurance valuation equivalent to $650 million as of 2018.

MMA is a modern sport that combines various martial arts techniques, whereas the Roman Colosseum games were a form of entertainment in ancient Rome that involved gladiatorial combat and other events. The rules, techniques, and purposes of the two are different, and MMA has evolved from a variety of martial arts traditions rather than originating directly from the Roman games.",False

Explanation: A tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the tonsils, which are glands found in the back of the throat. Hepatitis, on the other hand, is a disease that affects the liver. Since the tonsils and the liver are different organs, a tonsillectomy cannot cure hepatitis. The treatment for hepatitis would involve addressing the liver condition, not the tonsils.",False

Explanation: The context indicates that the Wehrmacht was the military of Germany from 1935 to 1945, which is after World War I, which ended in 1918. Therefore, the Wehrmacht did not affect the outcome of the War to End All Wars (World War I) as it did not exist during that time period.",False

Explanation: While there have been a few instances of deaths attributed to jokes or laughter throughout history, such as the case of Chrysippus and King Martin of Aragon, these instances are very rare. On the other hand, rats have been responsible for millions of deaths, particularly through the spread of diseases like the plague.

Justification: Aretha Franklin was born in 1942 and had her second child in 1957. To vote for a president in the United States, one must be at least 18 years old.

Could Palm Beach be held in the palm of your hand?,"['Palm Beach has a total area of 8.12 square miles.', 'The average palm is around 3 inches in length.', 'There are 63360 inches in a mile.']","Answer: False

Explanation: To determine if Palm Beach could be held in the palm of your hand, we need to compare the size of Palm Beach to the size of a palm.

1. Palm Beach has a total area of 8.12 square miles.
2. To convert this area into inches, we multiply by the number of inches in a mile: 8.12 * 63360 = 514,275.2 square inches.
3. The average palm is around 3 inches in length, and assuming a width of about the same, the area of a palm would be approximately 3 * 3 = 9 square inches.

Comparing the two areas:
- Palm Beach: 514,275.2 square inches
- A palm: 9 square inches

Given that the area of Palm Beach is significantly larger than the area of a palm, it is not possible to hold Palm Beach in the palm of your hand. Therefore, the answer is False.",False

It only mentions that the post office has several holidays, including Washington's Birthday (President's Day), but it does not specify if George Washington's actual birthday is a postal holiday. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the unanimously elected president's birthday is a break for mail carriers based on the given context.",True

Justification: According to the context, Bengal cats have powerful hind legs which make them jump higher than other breeds. The average cat can jump from 7.5 to 9 feet, which is already close to Javier Sotomayor's record of slightly over 8 feet. Given that Bengal cats can jump higher than the average cat, it is reasonable to assume that a Bengal cat could hypothetically best Javier Sotomayor's record.",True

Explanation: Based on the context provided, we can infer that most store bought rice pudding is not made with brown rice. The reasons are as follows:
1. Brown rice is more expensive than white rice, which would likely make it less cost-effective for mass-produced store bought rice pudding.
2. Most store bought rice pudding is white in color, which aligns with the color of white rice when cooked, not the light brown color of brown rice.",False

Could a hundred thousand lolcats fit on a first generation iPhone?,"['Lolcat memes are often in jpeg form', 'The average size of a jpeg is 10 to 30 kb', 'One gigabyte is 1000000 kb', 'The first iPhone had 4GB to 16GB of storage ']","Answer: True

Explanation: To determine if a hundred thousand lolcats can fit on a first-generation iPhone, we need to calculate the total storage required for these images and compare it to the available storage on the iPhone.

1. The average size of a jpeg is 10 to 30 kb.
2. Let's take the average size of a jpeg to be 20 kb (midway between 10 and 30 kb).
3. Total storage required for 100,000 lolcats = 100,000 * 20 kb = 2,000,000 kb.
4. One gigabyte is 1000000 kb.
5. The first iPhone had 4GB to 16GB of storage, which is 4,000,000 kb to 16,000,000 kb.

Since the total storage required for 100,000 lolcats (2,000,000 kb) is less than the minimum storage available on a first-generation iPhone (4,000,000 kb), it is possible to fit a hundred thousand lolcats on a first-generation iPhone. Therefore, the answer is True.",True

Would Methuselah hypothetically hold a record in the Common Era?,"['Methuselah was a biblical figure said to have lived until 969.', 'The Common Era is the years after the BC era and is alternatively referred to as A.D.', 'Jeanne Louise Calment 1875–1997 was the oldest human whose age was well-documented, with a lifespan of 122 years and 164 days.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Methuselah, being a biblical figure who lived until 969, would not hold a record in the Common Era (CE or AD), which starts after the BC era. The oldest human whose age was well-documented in the Common Era is Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived 122 years and 164 days. Therefore, Methuselah's age, while impressive, does not set a record within the time frame of the Common Era.",True

Were number of states in Ancient Greece underwhelming compared to US states in 1900?,"['In the year 1900 there were 42 US states.', 'Ancient Greece had several hundred relatively independent city-states called poleis.']","Answer: False

Justification: While Ancient Greece had several hundred relatively independent city-states (poleis), it is not accurate to compare them directly to the number of states in the US in 1900. The political structures and sizes of these city-states were significantly different from the states in the US. Therefore, it is not appropriate to label the number of city-states in Ancient Greece as ""underwhelming"" in comparison to the 42 US states in 1900, as they served different functions and had different scales of governance.",False

Can eating your weight in celery prevent diabetes?,"['Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot process sugar.', 'Celery is known as a healthy snack and has 1 gram of sugar per serving.', 'The recommended daily intake of sugar to prevent diabetes is less than 36 grams per day for an adult male.', 'The average weight of an adult male is 197 pounds.']","False

Explanation: While celery is a healthy snack with low sugar content, eating your weight in celery would not necessarily prevent diabetes. The context does not provide information on the direct impact of consuming large amounts of celery on diabetes prevention. Additionally, consuming such a large quantity of any food is not a practical or recommended approach to managing or preventing diabetes. The focus should be on a balanced diet and lifestyle, not on consuming excessive amounts of a single food item.",False

Reasoning: Given the context provided, it is highly unlikely that atheism would surpass Christianity in American black communities by 2021. With 83% of blacks in the US identifying as Christians, and the strong historical and cultural ties between African Americans and Christianity, the likelihood of atheism surpassing Christianity in this community within the specified timeframe is very low.

Would a packed Wembley stadium be likely to have a descendant of the Mongols inside?,"['Wembley stadium has a capacity of 90,000 people.', 'The Mongols were an ethnic group that dominated the 13th and 14th centuries.', 'Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol Empire.', 'Geneticists have determined that 1 in every 200 men are descended from Genghis Khan.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Given that Wembley stadium has a capacity of 90,000 people and geneticists have determined that 1 in every 200 men are descended from Genghis Khan, it is statistically likely that there would be at least one descendant of the Mongols in a packed Wembley stadium. To calculate this, we can estimate the number of men in the stadium and then apply the genetic probability:

Assuming an equal distribution of men and women, there would be approximately 45,000 men in the stadium. If 1 in 200 men are descended from Genghis Khan, then the calculation would be:

45,000 men / 200 = 225 men

Would a Bulgarian priest eat a four-course meal on Christmas Eve?,"['A four-course meal consists of a soup, an appetizer, an entrée, and dessert.', 'The Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal has an odd number of dishes and an odd number of people sitting around the table.']","False

Explanation: The context states that the Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal has an odd number of dishes, which does not align with the structure of a four-course meal, which has an even number of dishes (soup, appetizer, entrée, and dessert). Therefore, it is unlikely that a Bulgarian priest would eat a four-course meal on Christmas Eve.",False
Is Route 66 generally unknown to Americans?,"['Route 66 was immortalized in the hit ""Route 66"" by Bobby Troupe.', '""Route 66"" as a song has reached the Billboard Top Charts multiple times and is still played often.']","Answer: False

Justification: The context provided indicates that Route 66 is well-known among Americans due to its immortalization in the hit song ""Route 66"" by Bobby Troupe.

Explanation: According to the context provided, Jehovah Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will be saved and go to heaven. Since there are over 10 million residents in Los Angeles County, California, it is not possible for every resident to go to Jehovah Witnesses's heaven, as the number of people who will be saved is significantly lower than the total population of the county.",False
Would Emma Roberts's Nancy Drew be considered a private investigator?,"['Emma Roberts starred as Nancy Drew in the 2007 film titled Nancy Drew.', 'A private investigator is hired by an individual to solve a crime.', 'Nancy Drew from the 2007 film was described as an amateur sleuth.', 'Nancy Drew in the 2007 film was interested in a case and decided to pursue it on her own, without being paid for it.']","False

Explanation: While Nancy Drew from the 2007 film is involved in solving a crime, she is not considered a private investigator because she is not hired by an individual to solve the crime and does not receive payment for her investigative work. Instead, she is an amateur sleuth who pursues the case on her own interest.",False

Justification: The context provided mentions three different Star Wars TV shows produced by Disney: Star Wars Rebels, Star Wars Resistance, and The Mandalorian.

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Florence Nightingale died in her sleep, which typically implies a peaceful and painless death. In contrast, Saint Peter was crucified by the Romans, a method of execution known to be extremely painful and brutal. Therefore, it is not true that Florence Nightingale's death was more painful than Saint Peter's.",False
Would Iceland lose to Amazon in a bidding war?,"['Iceland had a nominal GDP of $27 billion as of a 2018 estimate.', 'Amazon recorded revenues of $232.887 billion in the 2018 fiscal year.']","Answer: True

Explanation: In a bidding war, the financial resources of the parties involved are a significant factor. Given that Amazon recorded revenues of $232.887 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, which is significantly higher than Iceland's nominal GDP of $27 billion, it is likely that Amazon would have more financial capacity to outbid Iceland in a bidding war. Therefore, the statement is true.",True

Could a Jujutsu expert hypothetically defeat a Janissary?,"['Jujutsu is a form of unarmed combat.', 'Janissaries were the elite infantry of the Ottoman Empire.', 'Janissaries wore chain mail and armor and wielded sharp swords.']","Answer: False

Justification: While jujutsu is a form of unarmed combat that could potentially be effective against an opponent, the context provided indicates that Janissaries were elite infantry soldiers equipped with chain mail, armor, and sharp swords. This level of protection and weaponry would likely give the Janissary a significant advantage over a jujutsu expert in a hypothetical confrontation, especially considering the Janissary's military training and combat experience. Therefore, it is unlikely that a jujutsu expert could hypothetically defeat a Janissary.",False
Would the Ku Klux Klan welcome Opal Tometi into their group?,"['The Ku Klux Klan is an American white supremacist hate group whose primary targets are African Americans, as well as Jews, immigrants, leftists, and homosexuals.', 'Opal Tometi is an African American woman.', 'Opal Tometi is a co-founder of Black Lives Matter.', 'Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people.']","Answer: False

Justification: Given the context, the Ku Klux Klan is a white supremacist hate group that primarily targets African Americans, among others. Opal Tometi is an African American woman and a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, a movement that opposes racial violence and police brutality against African Americans. It is highly unlikely that the Ku Klux Klan would welcome someone who is a target of their hate and who actively works against their ideologies.",False
Is calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles a preposterous claim?,"['ABBA was a Swedish band that had 1 Billboard number 1 hit and 4 top 10 hits.', 'The Beatles had 20 Billboard number 1 hits and 34 top 10 hits.']","Answer: True

Explanation: The context provided shows that The Beatles had significantly more success in terms of Billboard number 1 and top 10 hits compared to ABBA. The Beatles had 20 number 1 hits and 34 top 10 hits, while ABBA only had 1 number 1 hit and 4 top 10 hits. Therefore, calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles would be a preposterous claim, as The Beatles' achievements far surpass those of ABBA.",True
Do hyenas appear in a Broadway musical?,"[""Scar is the evil lion in Disney's Lion King."", ""Scar's minions are a group of hyenas."", 'There is a Broadway stage version of Lion King.']","Answer: True

Would a pacifist be opposed to hunting?,"['Pacifists are a group opposed to violence and war.', 'Amish people are well known for their pacifism.', 'Amish people hunt for meat and sport.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While pacifists are generally opposed to violence and war, the context provided does not explicitly state that pacifists are opposed to hunting.

Therefore, it cannot be definitively concluded that a pacifist would be opposed to hunting based on the given context.",False

', 'People who are born with a vagina may transition socially and/or medically to being male. ', 'Someone with a vagina who has transitioned to being male is a man. ']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context provided, menstruation can occur in any human being who has a uterus and vagina. Additionally, people who are born with a vagina may transition socially and/or medically to being male. Therefore, someone with a vagina who has transitioned to being male is still a man, and if they have a uterus, they can experience menstruation. This means there are indeed people who are men who experience menstruation.",True

Reasoning: Given Richard Dawkins' well-known atheism and his criticism of religious beliefs, it is highly likely that he would refuse an offering of the Last rites, which are a religious practice in Catholicism. His beliefs and public stance on religion suggest that he would not accept such a religious ritual.",True
Did Christopher Columbus condone multiple deadly sins?,"['The seven deadly sins are:  pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth.', ""Under Columbus, every native of fourteen years of age or upward was to pay a large hawk's bell of gold dust or cotton and those who could not pay were punished."", "" in just two years under Columbus's governorship, over 125,000 of the 250,000–300,000 natives in Haiti were dead.""]","Answer: True

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Christopher Columbus's actions can be associated with multiple deadly sins. The requirement for natives to pay a large hawk's bell of gold dust or cotton, and the punishment of those who could not pay, can be linked to greed and wrath. The high death toll of natives under his governorship also suggests a disregard for human life, which could be seen as a form of wrath. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Christopher Columbus condoned multiple deadly sins.",True
Would an American feel lost due to language barriers at Disneyland Paris?,"['All Disneyland Paris cast members are required to know and speak English.', 'Travelers from England go to Disneyland Paris often without issue.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While it is true that language barriers can sometimes be a concern when traveling, the context provided indicates that all Disneyland Paris cast members are required to know and speak English. This ensures that communication with English-speaking visitors, such as Americans, is not a significant issue. Additionally, the fact that travelers from England, where English is the primary language, often visit Disneyland Paris without issue further supports the conclusion that an American would not feel lost due to language barriers at Disneyland Paris.",False

Explanation: The context provided states that an M60 Patton is an army tank that weighs several tons, which is significantly larger and heavier than any animal a snake has been known to swallow. The largest animal a snake has been recorded to eat was an impala weighing 130 pounds, which is far less than the weight of an M60 Patton tank. Therefore, it is not possible for a snake to swallow an M60 Patton.",False
Are Brian Cranston and Saoirse Ronan's combined Emmy Awards a prime number?,"['Brian Cranston has won 6 Emmy Awards.', 'Saoirse Ronan has won 0 Emmy awards.', '6 is divisible by the following numbers: 1,2,3, and 6.']","Answer: True

Explanation: To determine if the combined Emmy Awards of Brian Cranston and Saoirse Ronan is a prime number, we need to add their Emmy Awards and check if the sum is a prime number.

Brian Cranston has won 6 Emmy Awards.
Saoirse Ronan has won 0 Emmy Awards.

Combined Emmy Awards = 6 (Brian Cranston) + 0 (Saoirse Ronan) = 6

Now, we check if 6 is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Since 6 has divisors other than 1 and itself (2 and 3), it is not a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is False.",False
Should you be skeptical of a 21 year old claiming to have a doctorate?,"['The average age that someone gets their doctorate at is 33. ', 'A doctorate takes an average of 8.5 years.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Based on the context provided, the average age for obtaining a doctorate is 33, and it typically takes 8.5 years to complete. A 21-year-old claiming to have a doctorate would be significantly younger than the average age, which is 12 years younger (33 - 21 = 12). Additionally, if we consider that a doctorate takes 8.5 years, this individual would have had to start their doctorate program at age 12.5 (21 - 8.5 = 12.5), which is highly unusual and unlikely. Therefore, it is reasonable to be skeptical of a 21-year-old claiming to have a doctorate.",True

Justification: Both Rurouni Kenshin and Nobunaga's Ambition are related to Japan.

Therefore, the lead characters in both series are from the same country, Japan.",True

Would Achilles dominate Legolas in a hypothetical fight?,"['Achilles was a Greek hero that was killed by an arrow to the heel.', 'Legolas is an elf archer from Lord of the Rings that can shoot arrows incredibly fast.', ""Achilles's companions included human warriors such as Ajax and Odysseus."", ""Legolas's companions include Gandalf who is a high level wizard, capable of casting many deadly spells.""]","False

Explanation: While Achilles was a formidable warrior, the context does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that he would dominate Legolas in a fight. Legolas is an expert archer and could potentially exploit Achilles's weakness (his heel). Additionally, Legolas's companions, such as Gandalf, could provide significant assistance in a fight. Therefore, without more specific details about the conditions of the hypothetical fight, it is not accurate to say that Achilles would definitely dominate Legolas.",False
Would a tool used for Martin Luther's Reformation opening salvo aid in a crucifixion?,"['Martin Luther began the Reformation with the defiant act of nailing 95 grievances to the door of the Wittenberg church.', 'Roman crucifixions required several tools including nails and wooden beams.']","False

The tool used for Martin Luther's Reformation opening salvo, which was nailing 95 grievances to the door of the Wittenberg church, would not aid in a crucifixion. While both actions involve the use of nails, the context and purpose of the tools are different. Martin Luther's act was a symbolic and religious protest, whereas crucifixion is a method of execution that requires specific tools and structures (like wooden beams) to carry out the punishment.",True
Could JPMorgan Chase give every American $10?,"['JPMorgan Chase has total assets of US$2.687 trillion.', 'As of November 8, 2018, the United States is estimated to have a population of 328,953,020.', 'One trillion is equal to 1,000 billions.', 'One billion is equal to 1,000 millions.']","False

To answer the question, we need to calculate if JPMorgan Chase's total assets are sufficient to give every American $10.

1. JPMorgan Chase has total assets of US$2.687 trillion.
2. The United States has an estimated population of 328,953,020.
3. One trillion is equal to 1,000 billions.
4. One billion is equal to 1,000 millions.

First, convert the total assets of JPMorgan Chase to billions:
2.687 trillion = 2.687 * 1,000 billion = 2,687 billion

Next, calculate the total amount needed to give every American $10:
328,953,020 * $10 = $3,289,530,200

Now, convert the amount needed to billions:
$3,289,530,200 / 1,000 million = 3.2895302 billion

Finally, compare the total assets of JPMorgan Chase to the amount needed:
2,687 billion (JPMorgan Chase's assets) > 3.2895302 billion (amount needed)

Since JPMorgan Chase's total assets are greater than the amount needed, the answer is False.",True

Justification: Given the context, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997, which coincides with the time of the Albanian Civil War (1997).

Would Arnold Schwarzenegger have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967?,"['In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.', 'Red foxes weigh between 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb).']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Arnold Schwarzenegger demonstrated significant strength in 1967 by winning the Munich stone-lifting contest, lifting a stone weighing 254 kg (560 lb). Red foxes, on the other hand, weigh between 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb). Given Schwarzenegger's strength, it would not be difficult for him to pick up a red fox in 1967. Therefore, the statement that he would have a hard time is false.",False
Could an NBA game be completed within the span of the Six-Day War?,"['The Six-Day War took place between June 5th-June 10th, 1967.', 'There are 24 hours in a day.', 'An NBA game consists of four quarters that are 12 minutes long and a 15 minute long halftime.', 'There are 60 minutes in an hour.']","Answer: True

Explanation: The Six-Day War lasted for 6 days, which is a total of 6 * 24 = 144 hours. An NBA game consists of four 12-minute quarters, a 15-minute halftime, and additional time for stoppages and potential overtime. The total time for a standard NBA game, including halftime and potential stoppages, is typically around 2-3 hours. Since 144 hours is significantly more than the time required for an NBA game, it is possible for an NBA game to be completed within the span of the Six-Day War.",True

Explanation: According to the context, Methuselah lived to the age of 969 years, while Sarah lived to the age of 127 years. To determine if Methuselah lived at least 800 years longer than Sarah, we need to calculate the difference between their ages: 969 - 127 = 842 years. Since 842 years is greater than 800 years, the statement is true.",True
Did Switzerland support the United States in the Spanish–American War?,"['The Spanish–American War was an armed conflict between Spain and the United States in 1898.', 'Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515.', 'Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.']","Answer: False

Explanation: According to the context, Futurama was cancelled in 2013 and has aired a total of 140 episodes. The Simpsons, on the other hand, is still creating new episodes as of May 2020 and has aired over 600 episodes. Since Futurama is no longer in production and has significantly fewer episodes than The Simpsons, it cannot surpass the number of episodes of The Simpsons by the end of 2020.",False

Would Bonanza marathon end before WWE Heat marathon?,"['Bonanza had a total of 431 episodes.', 'WWE Heat had a total of 513 episodes.', 'The average run time of WWE Heat was 45 minutes.', 'The average run time of Bonanza was 49 minutes.']","Answer: False

Explanation: To determine which marathon would end first, we need to calculate the total runtime of each marathon.

For Bonanza:
Total episodes = 431
Average run time = 49 minutes
Total runtime = 431 episodes * 49 minutes/episode = 21,119 minutes

For WWE Heat:
Total episodes = 513
Average run time = 45 minutes
Total runtime = 513 episodes * 45 minutes/episode = 23,085 minutes

Since the total runtime of WWE Heat (23,085 minutes) is greater than the total runtime of Bonanza (21,119 minutes), the Bonanza marathon would end before the WWE Heat marathon. Therefore, the answer is False.",False

Explanation: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, being a proponent of Communism, would not support Trickle Down Economics.

Explanation: While Dr. Seuss did not have a doctorate when he first published his children's books under the name Dr. Seuss, this does not necessarily make him a liar. The term ""Dr."" in his pen name could be seen as a playful or honorary title rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive. Additionally, he eventually did earn a doctorate in 1956, which further complicates the assertion that he was a liar.",True

Justification: The Olympiastadion Berlin, which was the venue for the 1936 Summer Olympics, has a capacity of over 74,000 people. The 2020 Superbowl, on the other hand, was attended by 62,417 fans.

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Hades has a strong grip on the Underworld. He alone can allow passage out of the Underworld, and he created a difficult task for Orpheus to complete to bring Eurydice back. Additionally, the subjects of Hades in the Underworld are under his complete control. These points suggest that Hades does not have a loose grip on the Underworld.",False
"In star rating systems, is 5 stars considered good?","['Most star rating systems are composed of 5 stars.', 'In star rating, most people want to avoid a 1 star review.']","Answer: True

Did Solomon make up bigger percentage of Islamic prophets than Kings of Judah?,"['According to The Quran, Solomon was one of 25 prophets.', 'According to some Islamic hadiths, there have been as many as 124,000 prophets.', 'Solomon was one of 20 Kings of Judah.']","Answer: False

Explanation: According to the context, Solomon was one of 25 prophets in the Quran, which is a small percentage (approximately 0.02%) of the total number of prophets mentioned in Islamic hadiths (124,000 prophets). On the other hand, Solomon was one of 20 Kings of Judah, which means he made up 5% of the Kings of Judah. Therefore, Solomon made up a smaller percentage of Islamic prophets than Kings of Judah.",False
Is a Coca plant farm likely to be found in Yakutsk?,"['Coca is a plant originating in South America and used as a cash crop.', 'Yakutsk is a city in east Siberia.', 'The Coca plant grows in a humid tropical climate.', 'Siberia has an extremely cold subarctic climate.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that the Coca plant originates in South America and requires a humid tropical climate to grow.

Is an internet connection essential for someone using Chrome OS?,"['Most Chromebook apps require internet access to function properly.', 'There are apps for the Chromebook that can function properly without internet access.', 'To download any apps onto the Chromebook, including offline apps, one must connect to the internet.']","False

Explanation: While it is true that most Chromebook apps require internet access to function properly, the context also states that there are apps that can function properly without internet access. Additionally, users can download offline apps with an initial internet connection. Therefore, an internet connection is not essential for someone using Chrome OS at all times, as they can use offline apps once they have been downloaded.",True
Would Goofy hypothetically enjoy Nylabone?,"['Goofy is a popular Disney cartoon character that is a dog.', 'Nylabone is a popular dog bone brand.', 'Dogs chew bones for the taste, and to exercise the muscles of the jaw.']","True

Justification:
1. Goofy is a dog character, and dogs generally enjoy chewing on bones.
2. Nylabone is a brand of dog bones, which are designed for dogs to chew on.
3. Since Goofy is a dog and dogs enjoy chewing bones for taste and jaw exercise, it is reasonable to assume that Goofy would hypothetically enjoy Nylabone.",True
Can surgery prevent an existential crisis?,"['Surgery is used to correct medical problems or make physical alterations to the body', 'An existential crisis is a metaphysical affliction']","False

Explanation: The context provided states that surgery is used to correct medical problems or make physical alterations to the body, which is a physical intervention. An existential crisis, on the other hand, is a metaphysical affliction, meaning it is related to philosophical or psychological issues rather than physical ones. Therefore, surgery cannot prevent an existential crisis as it does not address the underlying metaphysical or psychological concerns.",False
Does butter industry survive cow extinction?,"['Butter is a dairy product made from milk.', 'Cows are the predominant source of milk in the US.', 'Goats, sheep, buffalo, and other mammals produce milk.', ""Goat butter, made from 100% Goat's Milk, is an excellent source of Vitamin A.""]","False

Explanation: While it is true that other mammals such as goats, sheep, and buffalo produce milk, cows are the predominant source of milk for butter production in the US. If cows were to become extinct, the butter industry would face significant challenges as the primary source of milk for butter would be gone. Although alternative sources of milk exist, the infrastructure and market for cow's milk are far more extensive, and transitioning to other sources would not be immediate or easy. Therefore, the butter industry would struggle to survive in the event of cow extinction.",True
Can Centurylink max internet plan upload 1000GB in a fortnight?,"['A fortnight refers to a period of two weeks.', ""Centurylink's max internet plan speed is 1,000MB per second."", '1000GB takes 2.5 hours to upload for every 1000MB speed.']","Answer: True

Explanation: 
1. A fortnight is a period of two weeks, which is a total of 14 days.
2. Centurylink's max internet plan speed is 1,000MB per second.
3. To upload 1000GB at a speed of 1000MB per second, it takes 2.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time needed to upload 1000GB in a fortnight:

14 days * 24 hours/day = 336 hours

Since it takes 2.5 hours to upload 1000GB at the given speed, we can calculate the number of times this can be done in a fortnight:

336 hours / 2.5 hours = 134.4 times

Since we can't have a fraction of a time, we round down to 134 times. Therefore, the Centurylink max internet plan can upload 1000GB 134 times in a fortnight, which is more than enough to upload 1000GB in that period.",True

Justification: According to the context provided:
1. Software engineers require computers to do their work.
2. Computers do not work without electricity.
3. A power outage is the temporary lack of electrical power.

Since a power outage results in the lack of electrical power, and computers require electricity to function, a software engineer would not be able to work during a power outage as their primary tool (the computer) would be inoperable.",False
Are Big Ben's bells currently rung on their normal schedule at the Palace of Westminster?,"['Big Ben is currently under a four year renovation project.', 'The bells have been silenced for the duration of the work due to safety.', 'They are only rung on certain holidays, until the construction finishes in 2021.']","False

Explanation: According to the context, Big Ben's bells are currently not being rung on their normal schedule due to the ongoing four-year renovation project. The bells have been silenced for safety reasons and are only rung on certain holidays until the construction finishes in 2021.

Is it dangerous to consume chlorine when mixed with sodium?,"['Chlorine mixed with sodium is sodium chloride, also known as table salt.', 'Table salt is one of the most commonly consumed seasonings among all cultures.']","Answer: False

Justification: While chlorine mixed with sodium forms sodium chloride (table salt), which is a common seasoning, the question specifically asks about the danger of consuming chlorine when mixed with sodium. Since sodium chloride (table salt) is not dangerous when consumed in typical amounts, the statement that it is dangerous to consume chlorine when mixed with sodium is false. The context provided does not suggest that the mixture of chlorine and sodium in the form of table salt is dangerous under normal consumption circumstances.",False
Have any members of the 2020 British royal family allegedly committed a felony?,"['The 2020 British royal family includes Queen Elizabeth II and her children.', 'Prince Andrew is the son of Queen Elizabeth II.', 'Prince Andrew was accused of sexual abuse in 2019.', 'Sexual assault is classified as a felony.']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context provided, Prince Andrew, a member of the 2020 British royal family, was accused of sexual abuse in 2019. Since sexual assault is classified as a felony, it can be concluded that a member of the 2020 British royal family has allegedly committed a felony.",True
Can first letter row of QWERTY keyboard spell a palindrome?,"['The first letter row of the QWERTY keyboard contains: QWERTYUIOP', 'A palindrome is a word that can be spelled the same backwords and forwards such as racecar and rotor.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The first letter row of the QWERTY keyboard contains the letters QWERTYUIOP. To determine if this can spell a palindrome, we need to see if it can be spelled the same way backwards. When reversed, the letters become POIUYTREWQ, which is not the same as the original sequence. Therefore, the first letter row of the QWERTY keyboard cannot spell a palindrome.",True
Would a Drow tower over The Hobbit's hero?,"['The hero of the Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins.', 'Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit, which is a race resembling very short humans with furry feet.', 'Halfling is another term for hobbits, and halflings are described as being half the size of a human.', 'The Drow are a race of dark elves described as being around five feet in height.']","Answer: False

Explanation: According to the context, Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit, and hobbits are described as being half the size of a human. Since Drow are around five feet in height, they would not tower over Bilbo Baggins, as he would be approximately 2.5 feet tall. Therefore, a Drow would not tower over The Hobbit's hero.",True
Does March begin on the same day of the week as February during leap years?,"['During normal years, February has exactly 28 days, so March begins on the same day of the week as February.', 'However, on leap years, February has an extra day, so March begins the next day of the week from whichever day started February.']","False

Explanation: During leap years, February has 29 days instead of the usual 28. This extra day means that March does not start on the same day of the week as February. Instead, it starts on the next day of the week. For example, if February 1st is a Monday, February 29th will also be a Monday, and March 1st will be a Tuesday. Therefore, the statement ""March begins on the same day of the week as February during leap years"" is false.",False

Justification:
1. Curiosity (rover) weighs 1,982 pounds, which is significantly heavier than the average weight of a cat, which is between 7 to 10 pounds.
2. As mass falls, it picks up acceleration and adds to the force of impact. This implies that if Curiosity (rover) were to collide with a cat, the force of impact would be substantial due to the rover's mass.
3. Given the difference in mass and the potential for significant force upon impact, it is reasonable to conclude that Curiosity (rover) could potentially kill a cat if they were to collide.",True
Is Pan a symbol of virtue and virginity in women?,"['Pan is famous for his sexual powers.', 'Women who had had sexual relations with several men were referred to as ""Pan girls.""']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Pan is associated with sexual powers and women who had multiple sexual partners were referred to as ""Pan girls.""

Justification: According to the context, between 55 to 79 percent of people worldwide have brown eyes, and brown is the most common eye color. Since this percentage represents a majority of people, not a minority, the title of Van Morrison's most played song, ""Brown Eyed Girl,"" would apply to a majority of women worldwide, not a minority.",False
Do workers at Nissan's headquarters eat with chopsticks?,"[""Nissan's headquarters are located in Yokohama, Japan."", 'It is customary to eat with chopsticks in East Asian countries.', 'Japan is a country in East Asia.']","True

Justification:

Would Dante have hypothetically placed Nostradamus in 3rd Circle of Hell?,"['Nostradamus was a famous seer and court astrologer.', ""Dante's 3rd Circle of Hell is reserved for gluttons."", 'The 8th Circle of Hell is reserved for frauds.', ""Astrology was seen as a valuable skill during Dante's lifetime."", 'Dante places the mystic and prophet Joachim of Flora in the heaven of the sun.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Nostradamus, as a seer and court astrologer, would not be associated with gluttony, which is the sin punished in the 3rd Circle of Hell according to Dante's ""Inferno."" Astrology was considered a valuable skill during Dante's time, and given that Dante places the mystic and prophet Joachim of Flora in the heaven of the sun, it is more likely that Nostradamus would be associated with a different circle of Hell or possibly a different realm altogether, depending on how Dante viewed his contributions and prophecies. The 8th Circle of Hell, which is reserved for frauds, might be a more relevant circle to consider for Nostradamus, but without explicit evidence of Dante's views on Nostradamus, we cannot definitively place him in any circle.",False
Would Edward II of England have been born without Vikings?,"['Edward II was King of England from 1307-1327.', 'Rollo was a Viking who became the first ruler of Normandy.', 'William the Conqueror was the first Norman King of England and the great-great-great-grandson of Rollo.', ""Edward II is related to William the Conqueror through Rollo's granddaughter's line (Empress Matilda).""]","Answer: False

Explanation: Although Edward II of England was related to William the Conqueror through Rollo's granddaughter's line (Empress Matilda), it is not accurate to say that he would have been born without Vikings. The presence of Vikings in his ancestry indicates that their influence and lineage were part of the genetic and historical context that led to his birth. Therefore, it is not correct to imply that Edward II would not have been born if there were no Vikings.",False

Explanation: The 23rd Amendment specifically granted the right to vote in presidential elections to residents of Washington D.C., not to residents of Puerto Rico.

Were French people involved in the American Civil War?,"['The French General Lafayette allied with the American Revolutionaries.', ""Lafayette's army scored several key victories for the rebels.""]","Answer: False

Justification: The context provided relates to the American Revolution, not the American Civil War. The American Civil War took place from 1861 to 1865, while the American Revolution occurred from 1775 to 1783.

Is dysphoria around one's pelvis treatable without surgery?,"['For individuals experiencing dysphoria around having a vagina, packers can relieve symptoms.', 'For people experiencing dysphoria about having a penis, there are tucking underwear and comfort gaffs available.']","Answer: True

Reasoning: The context provided indicates that there are non-surgical options available for individuals experiencing dysphoria around their pelvis, regardless of whether they are dysphoric about having a vagina or a penis. Packers can help relieve symptoms for those dysphoric about having a vagina, while tucking underwear and comfort gaffs are available for those dysphoric about having a penis. Therefore, it is true that dysphoria around one's pelvis can be treatable without surgery.",True
Is popular science used to peer review papers?,"['Popular science is a simplified version of scientific work.', 'Peer review uses detailed scientific information to verify papers. ']","Answer: False

Explanation: Popular science is a simplified version of scientific work, which is not detailed enough for the rigorous process of peer review. Peer review requires detailed scientific information to verify and validate papers, so popular science would not be used for this purpose.",False
Would an average American Public University be welcoming to Ku Klux Klan members?,"['American Universities are known for being liberal in their demographics.', 'Groups like the Ku Klux Klan are condemned by liberal groups, as they advocate for human equality.']","Answer: False

Therefore, it is unlikely that an average American Public University would be welcoming to Ku Klux Klan members.",False
Would a lullaby be enough to wake Hellen Keller up?,"['Lullabies can be sung or played via instrument.', 'Hellen Keller was deaf. ']","False

Explanation: Since Helen Keller was deaf, she would not be able to hear a lullaby, whether it was sung or played via an instrument. Therefore, a lullaby would not be enough to wake her up.",False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that the Egyptian pyramids, such as the Great Pyramids, originally had a thin surface of limestone that made them shine in the sun. However, over time, this limestone layer has been removed by thieves and erosion, exposing the more common stone bricks underneath. Therefore, the pyramids do not look the same from the outside as they did when they were new.",False
Would Bruce Gandy be an odd choice for Messiah (Handel)?,"['Messiah (Handel) is a 1741 Oratorio by George Frideric Handel.', 'Messiah (Handel) requires the following instruments: 2 trumpets; timpani; 2 oboes; 2 violins; and a viola.', 'Bruce Gandy is a world renowned bagpipe player.']","Answer: True

Justification: The context provided indicates that Messiah (Handel) is a classical composition that requires specific orchestral instruments such as trumpets, oboes, violins, and a viola. Bruce Gandy, being a world-renowned bagpipe player, specializes in a completely different type of instrument that is not traditionally used in orchestral compositions like Messiah (Handel). Therefore, it would be an odd choice to have Bruce Gandy perform in this particular piece, as his expertise and instrument of choice do not align with the requirements of the composition.",True
Is accountant a difficult profession for a person suffering from Dyscalculia?,"['Accounting is a math intensive profession in which a person keeps or inspects financial accounts.', ""Dyscalculia is a math learning disability that impairs an individual's ability to represent and process numerical magnitude in a typical way.

Would an Orthodox Presbyterian object to 1700s judge's attire?,"['Judges in the 1700s wore powdered wigs and large robes during court proceedings.', 'Many Orthodox Presbyterians argue that the Bible prohibits adornment such as wigs and jewelry.', 'The 1 Timothy 2:8-9 Bible verse warns against adorning oneself with objects.']","Answer: True

Justification:
1. Judges in the 1700s wore powdered wigs and large robes during court proceedings.
2. Many Orthodox Presbyterians argue that the Bible prohibits adornment such as wigs and jewelry.
3. The 1 Timothy 2:8-9 Bible verse warns against adorning oneself with objects.

', 'Agnosticism is the belief that humanity is unsure if God exists.', 'Evangelical Christians share the belief that God exists.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Billy Graham was a prominent evangelical leader who preached the Gospel and the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Explanation: The context states that fully grown giraffes stand between 4.3-5.7 meters tall. Javier Sotomayor's world record in the high jump is 2.45 meters.

Reasoning: While it is true that internet trolls flock to popular platforms on the internet and Reddit is a popular website, it is not accurate to say that you cannot avoid internet trolls on Reddit.

Explanation: Given the context, it is likely that Kurt Cobain would have benefited from Project Semicolon.

The answer is False because ""Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes"" is not briefer than a haiku. Although it is a very short poem, a haiku typically consists of 17 syllables in a 5-7-5 structure. The poem ""Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes"" has more than 17 syllables when read aloud (""Adam. Had 'em."" has 6 syllables), so it is not shorter than a haiku in terms of syllable count.",True

Explanation: The Hundred Years' War is considered a misnomer because it lasted for 116 years, from 1337 to 1453, which is longer than one hundred years.

Wearing sandals in such cold temperatures would not be comfortable and could potentially lead to frostbite or other cold-related injuries.",False
Would Marvel's Gateway be envious of the Doctor (Doctor Who)'s TARDIS machine?,"['The Doctor (Doctor Who) used the TARDIS, a largely unreliable time traveling machine, to travel through time and space.', 'Gateway is a Marvel comic character linked to the X-Men comics.', 'Gateway has the power to create wormholes that allow him to travel through time and space.']","False

Explanation: While both the Doctor's TARDIS and Gateway have the ability to travel through time and space, there is no evidence or context provided that suggests Gateway would be envious of the TARDIS. Gateway has his own powers and abilities to create wormholes, and the comparison between the two is not based on any known narrative or character trait that indicates envy.",False
Would an art dealer prize a print of a Van Goh? ,"['Van Goh painted many valuable pieces of artwork in his lifetime.', ""Prints of Van Goh's artwork are readily available at a low price.""]","False

Explanation: While Van Gogh's original paintings are highly valuable and prized by art dealers, prints of his artwork are mass-produced and widely available at a much lower price. These prints, while they may be appreciated for their aesthetic value, do not hold the same monetary or collectible value as an original piece of art. Therefore, an art dealer would not prize a print of a Van Gogh in the same way they would prize an original piece.",False
Did Alfred Hitchcock include internet slang in his films?,"['Alfred Hitchcock died in 1908.', ""The internet began developing slang in the 1990's.""]","Answer: False

Explanation: Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980, not 1908. However, even with the correct death year, he still passed away before the internet slang began developing in the 1990s. Therefore, it is not possible for him to have included internet slang in his films.",False
Does welding with acetylene simulate the temperature of a star?,"['Acetylene is used for oxyacetylene welding ', 'An acetylene/oxygen flame burns at about 3,773 K ', 'The star Betelgeuse has a surface temperature of 3,500 K']","Answer: True

Reasoning: According to the context provided:
1. Acetylene is used for oxyacetylene welding.
2. An acetylene/oxygen flame burns at about 3,773 K.
3. The star Betelgeuse has a surface temperature of 3,500 K.

Since the temperature of an acetylene/oxygen flame (3,773 K) is higher than the surface temperature of the star Betelgeuse (3,500 K), welding with acetylene simulates a temperature higher than that of Betelgeuse. Therefore, the statement is true.",True

Given that the Red Sea is a saltwater body, it would indeed be unusual to find a yellow perch in the Red Sea, as they are not adapted to saltwater environments and are not native to that region.",True
Did Supernatural break 2001 CW debuting shows seasons record?,"['Smallville debuted on the CW in 2001.', 'Smallville had the record of most CW seasons for a show with 10.', 'Supernatural concluded its run with its record breaking 15th season on the CW.']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context provided:
1. Smallville debuted on the CW in 2001 and held the record for the most CW seasons with 10.
2. Supernatural concluded its run with its 15th season on the CW, which is a record-breaking number of seasons for a CW show.

Since Supernatural had more seasons (15) than Smallville (10), it did break the 2001 CW debuting shows seasons record.",True
Is Norman Oklahoma named after a viking?,"['The Normans invaded England in 1066 and were originally vikings from Scandinavia.', 'Norman Oklahoma was first surveyed by land surveyor Abner Norman in the 1800s.', '1066 is said to be the end of the Viking Era.']","False

Explanation: While the Normans were originally Vikings from Scandinavia, Norman Oklahoma was not named after a Viking. Instead, it was named after Abner Norman, the land surveyor who first surveyed the area in the 1800s. The connection to the Vikings is coincidental and not directly related to the naming of the city.",False
Would General Zod prefer an iPhone over a Samsung Galaxy S4?,"['General Zod is a villain.', 'Apple does not allow moviemakers to give villains iPhones.']","False

Explanation: The context states that Apple does not allow moviemakers to give villains iPhones. Since General Zod is a villain, he would not be portrayed as preferring an iPhone. Therefore, the answer is False.",False

Do people associate greyhounds with the movie 'Homeward Bound'?,"['The movie homeward bound features a golden retriever. ', 'The movie homeward bound features a pit bull type dog.', 'There are no greyhounds in homeward bound.']","False

The answer is False because the context provided indicates that there are no greyhounds featured in the movie 'Homeward Bound'. The movie includes a golden retriever and a pit bull type dog, but not a greyhound. Therefore, people would not associate greyhounds with this particular movie.",False
Does meat from cows fed only grass taste more like wild game?,"['The food an animal eats throughout its lifetime affect the way the meat from it will taste. ', 'Grass-fed cows produce meat that tends to taste more mineral-dense.', 'Wild game is known for a grassy, mineral taste.']","True

Explanation: Based on the context provided, it is stated that the food an animal eats affects the taste of its meat. Grass-fed cows produce meat that tends to taste more mineral-dense, which aligns with the taste profile of wild game, known for its grassy, mineral taste. Therefore, it can be concluded that meat from cows fed only grass would taste more like wild game.",True
Would World War II have been the same without Alan Turing?,"['During WW2, the German Military used something called the Engima device to send messages secretly. ', 'Alan Turing broke the Enigma code, allowing German messages to be understood and intercepted.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Without Alan Turing, World War II might have been significantly different. His work in breaking the Enigma code was crucial in allowing the Allies to understand and intercept German communications, which significantly impacted the war's outcome. Therefore, it is unlikely that the war would have been the same without his contributions.",False

Explanation: The number of JPMorgan Chase employees (256,981) is greater than the population of Samoa (200,874). This means that if each citizen of Samoa were to send a letter to a unique JPMorgan Chase employee, there would be enough employees to receive a letter from each citizen without any duplication.",True
Did George Washington drive a Lexus?,"['Lexus was established in 1989', 'George Washington died in 1799']","False

Explanation: George Washington died in 1799, which is long before Lexus was established in 1989. Therefore, it is not possible for George Washington to have driven a Lexus.",False
Is metal a type of folk music?,"['Folk music tends to be simple in structure, played on traditional acoustic instruments. Groups can be large but the song is designed to be playable by solo acts or small groups.', 'Metal music is designed to be as loud and epic-sounding as possible, often with complex structures and almost always with electric instruments.']","False

The answer is ""False"" because metal music is distinctly different from folk music in terms of structure, instrumentation, and overall sound. While folk music is characterized by simplicity and traditional acoustic instruments, metal music is known for its loudness, complexity, and use of electric instruments. These differences clearly distinguish metal from folk music.",False
Did Neanderthals use arithmetic?,"['The earliest written records indicate the Egyptians and Babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations as early as 2000 BC.', 'Neanderthals are an extinct species or subspecies of archaic humans who lived in Eurasia until about 40,000 years ago.']","Answer: Unknown

The context provided does not give any information about whether Neanderthals used arithmetic or not.

Explanation: The context provided indicates that during funerals, attendees often form a procession of cars to move from the memorial site to the cemetery. This procession typically follows special rules to keep the line assembled during transport. These special rules can be considered as special traffic laws associated with funerals, as they dictate how the vehicles should move and maintain order during the procession.",True
Would East India Company prefer China's modern trade?,"['China accounts for 4.6 trillion or 12.4% of global trade.', ""The East India Company took part in half of the world's trade from the 16th to 19th century.""]","Answer: True

Justification:
1. China's modern trade accounts for a significant portion (12.4%) of global trade, which indicates a large and lucrative market.
2. The East India Company was historically involved in a substantial portion (half) of the world's trade, suggesting a preference for engaging in large and profitable trade markets.

Given these points, it is reasonable to assume that if the East India Company were operating today, it would likely prefer to engage in China's modern trade due to its size and potential for profit.",False
Can 200 men end to end cover Great Pyramid of Giza's base?,"['The base of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 756 feet long.', 'The average height of a man is 5 foot 9.']","False

To answer the question, we need to determine if 200 men, standing end to end, can cover the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

1. The base of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 756 feet long.
2. The average height of a man is 5 foot 9, which is approximately 5.75 feet.

If we multiply the average height of a man by 200, we get:
5.75 feet * 200 = 1150 feet

Since 1150 feet is greater than the 756 feet base of the Great Pyramid of Giza, 200 men standing end to end would not cover the base but would extend beyond it. Therefore, the answer is False.",True
Would an actuary be confused about what prime numbers are?,"['Actuaries must go through college and rigorous studies in mathematics to obtain their jobs.', 'Prime numbers are introduced in basic high school mathematics. ']","False

Explanation: Given the context, actuaries undergo extensive mathematical training, which includes understanding basic concepts like prime numbers. Since prime numbers are introduced in basic high school mathematics, an actuary would not be confused about what prime numbers are.",False
Can ham make a cut seal up quicker?,"['Salt helps cleanse the skin by displacing bacteria in a cut.', '1 Cup of ham contains 1.684 mg of sodium.', 'Salt is a mineral made up mostly of sodium chloride.']","Answer: True

Explanation: The context provided indicates that salt helps cleanse the skin by displacing bacteria in a cut. Ham contains sodium, which is a component of salt (sodium chloride). Therefore, it can be inferred that the sodium in ham could potentially help cleanse the skin in a cut, which might contribute to the cut sealing up quicker.",True
Could Chuck Norris ride a horse?,"['Chuck Norris is a person.', 'Horses are bigger than people.', 'People can ride horses. ']","True

Explanation: 
1. The context states that a hound is a type of hunting dog, which includes Beagles among other breeds.
2. Snoopy, the dog in the Charlie Brown movies and books, is a Beagle.
3. Since Snoopy is a Beagle and Beagles are a type of hound, it is true that the animal in ""You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown"" could be hypothetically referred to as a hound.",True
Was 1941 Operation Barbarossa related to The Crusades?,"['Operation Barbarossa referred to the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union.', 'Frederick Barbarosa was the Holy Roman Empire that drowned while marching his army to The Crusades.', 'The Holy Roman Empire was a medieval empire that ruled over lands including what became modern Germany.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While both Operation Barbarossa and The Crusades involve historical military campaigns, they are not directly related. Operation Barbarossa was a specific event during World War II, involving the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. The Crusades, on the other hand, were a series of religious wars in the medieval period, primarily fought between Christians and Muslims over control of holy sites. The connection between the two is merely the name ""Barbarossa,"" which was used for both the German invasion operation and Frederick Barbarossa, a historical figure who participated in The Crusades. However, the events themselves are distinct and not directly related.",True
Is CAS number 8009-03-8 harmful for a rash?,"['Some common substances that help rashes are creams, oils, and petroleum based products.', 'CAS number 8009-03-8 is the identifier number for petroleum jelly.']","False

Explanation: Michael J. Fox has Parkinson's disease, which affects his mobility and coordination. Given the physical demands of completing a 12-mile march with a 35-pound rucksack and weapon in less than three hours, which is required to qualify for the Army Rangers, it is highly unlikely that he would be able to meet these physical requirements due to his condition.",False
Did Jay-Z ever collaborate with Louis Armstrong?,"['Jay-Z was born in 1969.', 'Louis Armstrong died in 1971.']","False

Explanation: Since Louis Armstrong died in 1971 and Jay-Z was born in 1969, there would not have been an opportunity for them to collaborate during their lifetimes.",False
Are any of J.K. Rowling's books in the genre of And Then There Were None?,"['And Then There Were None was a mystery novel written by Agatha Christie.', 'J.K. Rowling is best known for her wizard fantasy series Harry Potter.', ""Robert Galbraith is the author of the Cuckoo's Calling, a mystery crime fiction novel."", 'Robert Galbraith is the pseudonym that J.K. Rowling writes under.']","Answer: True

Justification: 
1. And Then There Were None is a mystery novel written by Agatha Christie.
2. J.K. Rowling is best known for her wizard fantasy series Harry Potter, which is not in the mystery genre.
3. However, Robert Galbraith, who is the author of the mystery crime fiction novel Cuckoo's Calling, is a pseudonym used by J.K. Rowling.
4. Since J.K. Rowling writes under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, and Robert Galbraith's book is in the mystery genre, it can be concluded that J.K. Rowling has written books in the genre of And Then There Were None.",True
Would a model be appropriate to star in a LA Femme Nikita remake?,"['La Femme Nikita is a French movie about a beautiful female assassin.', 'Models are known for their beauty and height.', 'Peta Wilson and Maggie Q have played the lead role in La Femme Nikita spinoffs.', 'Peta Wilson and Maggie Q have both done extensive modeling work.']","True

Explanation: Given the context, a model would be appropriate to star in a LA Femme Nikita remake because the original movie is about a beautiful female assassin, and models are known for their beauty. Additionally, Peta Wilson and Maggie Q, who have played the lead role in La Femme Nikita spinoffs, have both done extensive modeling work, further supporting the idea that a model could be suitable for the role.",True
Can Ford F-350 tow entire Yale University student body?,"['The Yale University student body consists of 12,385 people according to a 2015 poll.', 'The average US male weighs 195 pounds.', 'The average US female weighs 168 pounds.', 'The maximum towing capacity of the Ford F-350 is 15,000 pounds.']","Answer: False

Reasoning: To determine if the Ford F-350 can tow the entire Yale University student body, we need to calculate the total weight of the student body. We can estimate the average weight of a student by taking the average of the male and female weights: (195 + 168) / 2 = 181.5 pounds. 

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the student body: 12,385 students * 181.5 pounds/student = 2,246,977.5 pounds.

Since the maximum towing capacity of the Ford F-350 is 15,000 pounds, it cannot tow the entire Yale University student body, as the total weight is significantly higher than the towing capacity.",False

2. Coins, including the One Euro coin, sink in water due to their density being higher than water.
3. Since the One Euro is a coin, it will indeed sink in water.",True
Is Drew Carey important to the history of wrestling?,"['Drew Carey competed in the 2001 Royal Rumble.', 'The Royal Rumble is one of the Big 4 yearly WWE pay per view events.', 'Drew Carey was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011.']","Answer: False

Justification: While Drew Carey did participate in the 2001 Royal Rumble and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011, his involvement in wrestling is more of a novelty or side event rather than a significant contribution to the history of wrestling. His induction into the Hall of Fame was likely more for entertainment value and his celebrity status rather than his impact on the sport itself. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to say that Drew Carey is important to the history of wrestling.",True
Did Larry King sign the Magna Carta?,"['The Magna Carta was a charter of rights signed by King John in 1215.', 'Larry King was born in 1933.']","Answer: False

', 'Justin Bieber is a famous pop singer.', 'Punk is a music subculture that clashes against mainstream topics, ideals, and subjects.', 'Pop music is a mainstream form of music constructed to appeal to the masses.']","False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Iggy Pop, a punk rocker, and Justin Bieber, a pop singer, belong to different music subcultures with contrasting ideologies. Punk music is known for its opposition to mainstream culture, while pop music is designed to appeal to the masses. Therefore, it is unlikely that Iggy Pop would travel with Justin Bieber due to their differing musical backgrounds and cultural stances.",False

Did Jackie Kennedy wear Dolce & Gabbana to her husband's inauguration?,"[""Jackie Kennedy's husband was John F. Kennedy"", 'John F. Kennedy was inaugurated in 1961', 'Dolce & Gabbana was founded in 1985']","False

Explanation: Jackie Kennedy's husband, John F. Kennedy, was inaugurated in 1961. Dolce & Gabbana, the fashion house, was not founded until 1985, which is 24 years after the inauguration. Therefore, it is not possible for Jackie Kennedy to have worn Dolce & Gabbana to her husband's inauguration.",False
Do quadragenarian's have little memory capacity?,"['Quadragenarians are people that are in their 40s.', 'As people age, their memory can get worse.', 'Half of people over age 50 have mild to severe memory loss.', 'Ken Jennings was 46 years old when he won Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time tournament.']","False

Explanation: While it is true that memory can decline with age, the context does not provide specific information about the memory capacity of quadragenarians (people in their 40s). The example of Ken Jennings, who was 46 when he won a major memory-based competition, suggests that not all individuals in their 40s have reduced memory capacity. Therefore, the statement that quadragenarians have little memory capacity is not supported by the provided context.",False

Explanation: According to the context provided, both Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley have a Bacon Number of 2, meaning they are both two connections away from Kevin Bacon. Since they have the same Bacon Number, they would not score the same amount of Bacon Number points. The statement is false because they have equal Bacon Number scores, not different ones.",True
Does horseradish have a fetlock?,"['Horseradish is a type of plant that is used as a condiment.', 'Fetlock is the common name used for a joint found in horses.']","False

The answer is False because the context states that a diamond is more dense than water (3.51 g/cm³ compared to water's density of 997 kg/m³). Since a diamond is more dense, it will not float on water; instead, it will sink.",False
Would Carolina Reaper decrease sales if added to all US salsa?,"['On average, Americans prefer milder salsa than Europeans.', 'The Carolina Reaper is the hottest pepper in the world. ', 'The Carolina Reaper is rated as 2,200,000 Scoville Heat Units.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Given the context, it is likely that adding the extremely hot Carolina Reaper pepper to all US salsa would decrease sales. Americans generally prefer milder salsa, and the Carolina Reaper is the hottest pepper in the world, rated at 2,200,000 Scoville Heat Units. This extreme heat level would not align with the average American's preference for milder salsa, potentially leading to a decrease in sales.",True

Explanation: The context states that macaques grow up to 28 inches in length. While this is close to the height of a typical desk (29 to 30 inches from the ground), it does not account for the width and depth of the desk, as well as the space needed for the macaque to move and be comfortable. Additionally, hiding a pet macaque under a desk would likely be impractical and potentially unsafe for both the macaque and the person. Therefore, the answer is False.",True

The outcome was a transformation of the political and social structure within France, not a victory in a war between nations.",False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Pope Alexander VI was from Spain, and there have been two Popes from Spain (including Pope Alexander VI and Pope Callixtus III). On the other hand, Pope John Paul II is the only Pope of Polish origin. Therefore, Spain is not the least represented country in papal history, as it has had two Popes, while Poland has had only one.",False

Explanation: Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a condition that affects the heart, not the brain. It occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, leading to damage to the heart muscle. Since the question asks if it is a brain problem, and the context clearly states that myocardial infarction is a heart problem, the answer is False.",False
Is Newspeak considered very straightforward?,"['The vocabulary in Newspeak is extremely restricted.', 'In Newspeak, the Ministry of Truth manufactures lies for the public to consume.', 'In Newspeak, the Ministry of Plenty artificially creates scarcity.', 'To be straightforward is to be uncomplicated and easy to understand.']","False

Explanation: While Newspeak has a restricted vocabulary, which might suggest simplicity, the context provided shows that it is used to manipulate and deceive the public (manufacturing lies and creating artificial scarcity). This manipulation and the purpose behind Newspeak's creation make it not straightforward in the sense of being uncomplicated and easy to understand. Instead, it is designed to control and limit thought, which is a complex and deceptive use of language.",False
Were muskets used in the Pacific War?,"['The Pacific War took place between 1941 and 1945.', 'The musket became obsolete in modern warfare starting near 1870.']","False

Explanation: The Pacific War occurred between 1941 and 1945, which is well after the musket became obsolete in modern warfare around 1870. Therefore, muskets were not used in the Pacific War.",False

Explanation: The context provided states that yin and yang are represented by black and white, which when mixed together create gray. However, rainbows contain a spectrum of colors including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Therefore, rainbows are not devoid of color and are not made by mixing yin and yang colors.",True
Does autopilot rely on fossil fuels?,"['Autopilot is used in vehicles.', 'Vehicles are powered by engines.', 'Engines rely on fossil fuels to operate.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While the context states that vehicles are powered by engines and engines rely on fossil fuels to operate, it does not directly link autopilot systems to the use of fossil fuels. Autopilot is a feature that controls the navigation and operation of a vehicle without constant human input. It does not inherently rely on fossil fuels for its operation; rather, it is the vehicle's engine that uses fossil fuels. Therefore, the statement that autopilot relies on fossil fuels is not accurate based on the provided context.",True
Does the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution protect freedom of speech?,"['The Eighth Amendment (Amendment VIII) of the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishments.', 'The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech.']","False

Can Family of Barack Obama ride comfortably in 2020 Jaguar F Type?,"['Barack Obama has a wife and two children.', 'The 2020 Jaguar F Type is a car that seats two people.']","False

Explanation: The 2020 Jaguar F Type is designed to seat only two people, while Barack Obama's family consists of four members (himself, his wife, and two children). Therefore, the family would not be able to ride comfortably in the car as it cannot accommodate all of them at once.",False

Explanation: Elementary school students, who are typically in grades K-5, are just beginning to understand basic mathematical concepts such as decimals and fractions. Graphing calculators are designed for more advanced mathematical work, such as complex equations and functions, which are typically introduced in late middle school or high school. Therefore, it is not typical for elementary school students to need graphing calculators.",False
Did the leader of Heaven's Gate consider himself a prophet?,"[""The leader of Heaven's Gate was Marshall Applewhite."", 'Marshall Applewhite said he was called to be a messenger of the divine.']","True

Explanation: According to the context, Marshall Applewhite, the leader of Heaven's Gate, stated that he was called to be a messenger of the divine.

Justification:
1. Cardi B is lactose intolerant, which means she cannot consume dairy products.
2. Soy milk is a dairy-free alternative to milk, making it suitable for people with lactose intolerance.
3. Therefore, Cardi B would benefit from consuming soy milk as it provides a suitable alternative to dairy milk for her dietary needs.",True
Would King Leonidas have succeeded with an army the size of Mozart's compositions?,"['King Leonidas led 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians against the Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae.', 'The Persian army had around 150,000 soldiers at the Battle of Thermopylae.', 'Mozart composed 600 works.']","False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that King Leonidas led a small force of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians against a much larger Persian army of around 150,000 soldiers. Mozart's compositions, totaling 600 works, are not a measure of an army's size. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the success of King Leonidas with an army the size of Mozart's compositions, as they are unrelated concepts. The answer is ""False"" because the question is based on an invalid comparison.",False
Phileas Fogg's around the world would be difficult to achieve during Pope John Paul I's reign?,"[""Phileas Fogg is a character in Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days."", 'Phileas Fogg attempts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days.', 'Pope John Paul I reigned for only 33 days.']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context, Phileas Fogg attempts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. Pope John Paul I reigned for only 33 days. Therefore, it would be difficult for Phileas Fogg to complete his around-the-world journey during Pope John Paul I's reign, as the Pope's reign was significantly shorter than the time required for the journey.",True
Can someone with celiac disease have potato vodka?,"['Celiac disease makes it unsafe for someone to eat gluten.', 'Potato vodka is a gluten free product.']","True

Explanation: Since potato vodka is a gluten-free product, it is safe for someone with celiac disease to consume, as it does not contain gluten, which is the substance that they need to avoid.",True
Could all of the famous Apollo's hypothetically defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's?,"[""The famous D'artagnan was a musketeer based on a count that served Louis XIV"", ""There are at least three famous Apollo's: Apollo Creed, Apollo (Greek mythology), and Apollo Crews."", 'Apollo, the Greek god of the sun and healing, is immortal.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Given the context, we can analyze the abilities of the famous Apollo's and the famous D'Artagnan's. 

1. D'Artagnan was a skilled musketeer, but he was still a human with limitations.
2. Apollo Creed is a fictional character from the Rocky movies, known for his boxing skills. Apollo Crews is a professional wrestler. Both of these Apollos are skilled fighters, but they are not immortal.
3. Apollo, the Greek god of the sun and healing, is immortal and possesses divine powers.

Considering the immortal and powerful Greek god Apollo, it is reasonable to assume that all of the famous Apollo's could hypothetically defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's.",True
Are blue lips normal?,"['Lips and skin turn blue in response to a lack of oxygen.', ""When oxygen flow is inadequate, someone's health can be in danger."", 'Lips can turn blue due to extreme cold.']","False

The answer is ""False"" because, although deaf people experience music differently, they are not completely left out of enjoying it. As mentioned in the context, those with total hearing loss can still feel the bass and beat through vibrations, and those with cochlear implants can hear music in a different way. This shows that there are ways for deaf people to engage with and enjoy music, even if their experience is not identical to that of hearing individuals.",False
Are cucumbers often found in desert?,"['Cucumbers are a kind of vegetable.', 'With the exception of carrot cake, deserts are not typically made with vegetables.', 'Cucumbers are not the vegetable used in carrot cake.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that tonsure involves shaving the hair from the top of the head, and the laurel crown given to winners of the ancient Olympics covers only the edges of the head. Therefore, the laurel crown would not be able to hide the tonsure, as it does not cover the shaved part of the head.",True
Can someone with dermatitis be a hand model?,"['Dermatitis causes rashes, redness, blisters, cracking of the skin, and scarring. ', 'Hand models tend to have flawless skin and hands.']","False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, dermatitis causes various skin issues such as rashes, redness, blisters, cracking, and scarring. Hand models, on the other hand, require flawless skin and hands. Due to the skin issues caused by dermatitis, it would be difficult for someone with this condition to meet the requirements of being a hand model. Therefore, the answer is False.",False
Can dessert be made with vegetables?,"['A popular desert is carrot cake.', 'Carrot cake is made with carrots.', 'Carrots are a kind of vegetable.']","True

Was Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff in 2009 baptised?,"[""Huma Abedin was Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff in 2009"", 'Huma Abedin is an American Muslim', 'Baptism is a Christian tradition']","Answer: False

Justification: Since Huma Abedin is an American Muslim and baptism is a Christian tradition, it is unlikely that she was baptized. Therefore, the statement that Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff in 2009 was baptized is false.",False
Did Jon Brower Minnoch suffer from anorexia nervosa?,"['Jon Brower Minnoch was an American man who, at his peak weight, was the heaviest human being ever recorded, weighing 1,400 lb.', 'Anorexia nervosa,Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder, characterized by low weight, food restriction, fear of gaining weight, and a strong desire to be thin. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are, in fact, underweight.']","Answer: False

Justification: Jon Brower Minnoch was the heaviest human being ever recorded, weighing 1,400 lb. This is in stark contrast to anorexia nervosa, which is characterized by low weight, food restriction, fear of gaining weight, and a strong desire to be thin. Minnoch's condition and anorexia nervosa are opposite in nature, making it unlikely that he suffered from anorexia nervosa.",False
Would Othello be Shakespeare's play to buy Scheherazade most time with king?,"['Scheherazade was a character in Middle Eastern folklore that delayed her execution by telling the king long stories.', ""Shakespeare's play Othello contained 26,450 words."", ""Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play consisting of 4000 lines and 30,000 words.""]","False

Explanation: The context provided does not support the idea that Othello would be Shakespeare's play to buy Scheherazade the most time with the king. While Othello is a substantial play, Hamlet is longer with more words and lines. Scheherazade's goal was to delay her execution by telling long stories, so a longer play like Hamlet would be more relevant to her situation. Therefore, the answer is False.",False

Is a Cassowary safer pet than a crane?,"[""Crane's that are fed by humans can exhibit domestic tendencies and rarely peck at humans."", ""The Cassowary, known as the world's most dangerous bird, becomes very aggressive and has even killed humans and dogs.""]","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, a Cassowary is considered the world's most dangerous bird due to its aggressive behavior and history of killing humans and dogs. In contrast, cranes can exhibit domestic tendencies when fed by humans and rarely pose a threat to them. Therefore, a crane would be a safer pet than a Cassowary.",False
Did any citizen of San Antonio vote for Boris Johnson?,"['San Antonio is a city in Texas in the United States of America', 'Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister of the UK', 'Only UK and commonwealth citizens may vote in UK elections']","False

Was proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works lucrative?,"['Proofreaders get paid a set rate based on the number of words in a document.', 'Edgar Allan Poe wrote many short stories including the Oval Portrait which is two pages in length.', ""Edgar Allan Poe's only complete novel: The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was a mere 166 pages."", ""A book like Jeyamohan's Venmurasu is 11,159 pages.""]","False

Reasoning: While Edgar Allan Poe did write numerous works, including short stories and a novel, the context provided does not indicate that proofreading his works would be particularly lucrative compared to other authors who may have written longer or more voluminous works, such as Jeyamohan's Venmurasu, which is significantly longer at 11,159 pages. The context does not provide information on the specific rates proofreaders received during Poe's time or how his works compared to others in terms of payment for proofreading services. Therefore, we cannot conclude that proofreading Poe's works was lucrative based on the given context.",False
Was Mozart accused of stealing from Richard Wagner?,"['Mozart died in 1791.', 'Richard Wagner was born in 1813.']","False

Explanation: Mozart died in 1791, while Richard Wagner was born in 1813. Since Mozart died before Wagner was even born, it would be impossible for Mozart to be accused of stealing from Wagner.",False

Could you drive from New England to a Sainsbury's?,"['New England is located in the United States of America.', 'The U.K and New England are separated by a large ocean.']","False

Explanation: The context states that New England is in the United States and Sainsbury's is a supermarket chain in the U.K. Since the two locations are separated by a large ocean, it is not possible to drive directly from New England to a Sainsbury's without crossing the ocean, which would require a different mode of transportation such as a ferry or a plane.",False
Can Curiosity take samples of rocks from Lacus Temporis?,"['Curiosity is a rover exploring Mars', 'Lacus Temporis is located on the moon']","Answer: False

Do seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat allowance?,"[""The fat content of one McDonald's hamburgers is 10 grams."", 'The USDA recommends between 44 and 77 grams of fat a day.']","False

Explanation: To determine if seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed the USDA recommended fat allowance, we need to calculate the total fat from the hamburgers and compare it to the USDA recommendation.

1. The fat content of one McDonald's hamburger is 10 grams.
2. Seven hamburgers would have a total fat content of 7 * 10 = 70 grams.

The USDA recommends between 44 and 77 grams of fat a day. Since 70 grams falls within the USDA recommended range (44 to 77 grams), it does not exceed the recommended fat allowance. Therefore, the answer is False.",False
Is H's most common two letter pair partner a freebie in Wheel of Fortune bonus round?,"['H forms the most common two letter pair in the English language along with the letter T.', 'The Wheel of Fortune bonus round gives the player six free letters: R, S, T, L, N, E.']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context, H forms the most common two letter pair in the English language along with the letter T.

Since T is a freebie in the bonus round and it is the most common partner of H, it can be considered as a freebie for the H's most common two letter pair partner.",True
Would P. G. Wodehouse be taught in second grade?,"['Second graders are often aged seven or eight.', 'The works of Wodehouse are intended for an adult audience.']","False

Explanation: Given the context, second graders are typically aged seven or eight, and the works of P. G. Wodehouse are intended for an adult audience. Therefore, it is unlikely that Wodehouse's works would be taught in second grade, as the content would not be suitable or understandable for children of that age.",False
Could SNL be why Jenny McCarthy does not get along with her cousin?,"[""Jenny McCarthy is cousin's with Melissa McCarthy."", ""Melissa McCarthy and Jenny McCarthy are not close and Melissa did not even attend Jenny's wedding."", 'Jenny McCarthy was spoofed in n episode of SNL (Saturday Night Live) for a rant she did on The View.', 'Melissa McCarthy has been a frequent guest on SNL (Saturday Night Live) from 2011-2017.', 'Melissa McCarthy was nominated five times for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her appearances on SNL.']","False

Explanation: While it is mentioned that Jenny McCarthy was spoofed on SNL and Melissa McCarthy has been a frequent guest on the show, there is no direct evidence or context provided that links SNL as the reason why Jenny McCarthy does not get along with her cousin, Melissa McCarthy. The lack of closeness and Melissa not attending Jenny's wedding could be due to various reasons, and without explicit information connecting SNL to their strained relationship, we cannot conclude that SNL is the cause.",True
Can children become lieutenants?,"['Lieutenant the second junior-most or in some cases the junior-most commissioned officer in the armed forces, fire services, police, and other organizations of many nations.', 'Many gangs use military rankings to describe their internal heirarchy.', 'Many young children are inducted into gangs with heirarchies.', 'Children can grow up to be whatever they want to be. ']","Answer: True

Justification: According to the context provided, children can indeed become lieutenants, but not in the traditional sense of the armed forces or police. The context mentions that many gangs use military rankings to describe their internal hierarchy, and many young children are inducted into these gangs with hierarchies. Therefore, it is possible for a child to hold a rank equivalent to a lieutenant within a gang's structure. The statement ""Children can grow up to be whatever they want to be"" is a general encouragement but does not directly relate to the specific question of becoming a lieutenant in a formal military or police context. However, it does not contradict the possibility of a child becoming a lieutenant in a gang's hierarchy.",True
Can Tame Impala's studio band play a proper game of Hot Potato?,"['Hot Potato is a game in which two or more people toss a potato until the music stops.', 'Tame Impala is a band with one member, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker.']","False

Justification: The title of Shirley Bassey's 1971 song, ""Diamonds are Forever,"" is not a true statement according to the context provided. While the song suggests that diamonds are eternal, context 2 states that over time, diamonds degrade and turn into graphite, which contradicts the idea that diamonds are forever.",False

Can Simon Cowell vote for the next Supreme Court judge?,"['The Supreme Court is the highest court in the USA.', 'Simon Cowell is a British talent competition judge.', 'Members of the Supreme Court are appointed, rather than elected.']","False

Explanation: Simon Cowell, being a British citizen and not a member of the U.S. government, does not have the authority or ability to vote for or appoint a Supreme Court judge in the United States. The appointment of Supreme Court judges is done by the President and confirmed by the Senate, not through a popular vote.",False
Is overfeeding Lactobacillus unwise for people without dental insurance?,"['Lactobacillus species convert sugars they digest to lactic acid ', 'The lactic acid of some Lactobacillus species is associated with tooth decay', 'Dental procedures can be expensive without insurance']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context, Lactobacillus species produce lactic acid when they digest sugars, and this lactic acid is associated with tooth decay.

Can a cell fit inside of a shoebox?,"['The average shoebox is around 14 inches by 10 inches by 5 inches', 'The average eukaryotic cell is between 1 and 100 micrometers in diameter']","Answer: True

Justification: The average eukaryotic cell, which includes most cells in multicellular organisms, has a diameter between 1 and 100 micrometers. A micrometer (µm) is one millionth of a meter, or 0.000001 meters. In comparison, a shoebox, even at its smallest dimension (5 inches), is significantly larger. Converting 5 inches to meters gives approximately 0.127 meters. This is 127,000 micrometers, which is vastly larger than the size of any cell. Therefore, a cell can easily fit inside a shoebox, as the scale difference is enormous.",True
Is nickel a better payout than mercury if given a dollar per atomic number?,"['Nickel is a metallic substance with the chemical atomic number of 28.', 'Mercury is a silvery liquid substance with a chemical number of 80.']","False

Explanation: The question asks if nickel is a better payout than mercury if given a dollar per atomic number. Nickel has an atomic number of 28, and mercury has an atomic number of 80. If you were given a dollar per atomic number, mercury would be a better payout because its atomic number is higher (80) compared to nickel's atomic number (28). Therefore, the answer is False.",False
Does Pikachu like Charles Darwin?,"['Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution', 'Pikachu is a Pokemon', 'Pokemon rely on evolution in order to transform into stronger forms']","Answer: True

Justification: According to the context provided, Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution, which is a concept that is relevant to the world of Pokemon, as they rely on evolution to transform into stronger forms. While it is not explicitly stated that Pikachu likes Charles Darwin, it can be inferred that Pikachu, being a Pokemon, would benefit from the understanding of evolution provided by Darwin's theory. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Pikachu would have a positive association with Charles Darwin.",True
Could all the unemployed people due to 1933 Great Depression fit in Tiger Stadium?,"['There were approximately 15 million people unemployed in 1933 due to the Great Depression.', 'In the 1930s Tiger Stadium had a capacity around 50,000.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The number of unemployed people during the 1933 Great Depression was approximately 15 million. Tiger Stadium, even at its peak capacity in the 1930s, could only hold around 50,000 people. Therefore, it is not possible for all the unemployed people from that period to fit into Tiger Stadium, as the number is significantly larger than the stadium's capacity.",False
Can Aerosmith fit in a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?,"['Aerosmith is an American rock band that has five active members.', 'The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander has flexible seating that allows for seven seat capacity.']","True

Justification:
1. Aerosmith has five active members.
2. The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander has a seating capacity of seven.

Explanation: According to the context provided, Melinda Clarke, who played an Amazon on ""Xena: Warrior Princess,"" went on to star in later TV shows such as ""The O.C."" and ""Nikita."" This confirms that at least one of the actresses who portrayed an Amazon on the show did indeed star in later television series.",True
Could all of the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day fit in Dorton Arena?,"['J. S. Dorton Arena is a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena located in Raleigh, North Carolina.', 'On an average day in fiscal 2013, about 12,000 people boarded or left trains at 30th Street.']","False

Explanation: Dorton Arena has a seating capacity of 7,610 people. On an average day, 30th Street Station sees about 12,000 people boarding or leaving trains. Therefore, all of the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day could not fit in Dorton Arena, as the arena's capacity is less than the number of people passing through the station.",False
Was Dioskourides a lapidary?,"['A lapidary is a person or machine who cuts gemstones; classically, it refers to a person who engraves gemstones.', 'Dioskourides put his signature on a Roman amethyst ringstone with a portrait of Demosthenes circa late 1st century BC.', 'Artists sign their work.']","Answer: True

Would a CEO typically clean the toilets in a company's building?,"['The CEO is the highest-ranking corporate position in an organization.', 'Cleaning toilets is a job typically done by janitors or facility workers in a company.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, the CEO is the highest-ranking corporate position in an organization, which typically involves high-level decision-making and strategic planning rather than performing tasks like cleaning toilets. Cleaning toilets is a job typically done by janitors or facility workers, not by the CEO. Therefore, it is unlikely that a CEO would typically clean the toilets in a company's building.",False
Can an adult male stand on top Donatello's bronze David and touch the Sistine Chapel ceiling?,"[""Donatello's created a bronze David statue that stands over five feet tall."", 'The average height of an adult male is five feet and nine inches.', 'The tallest adult male in history was eight feet and eleven inches.', 'The Sistine Chapel ceiling is sixty eight feet high.']","False

Explanation: Even though the average adult male is taller than Donatello's bronze David statue, which stands over five feet tall, the Sistine Chapel ceiling is 68 feet high. No adult male, even the tallest in history, who was eight feet and eleven inches tall, could stand on top of the statue and touch the ceiling. The height difference is too great.",False
Was England directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict?,"['The Arab-Israeli conflict began hundreds of years ago.', 'England occupied what is now Israel until 1945 when Israel became independent.', ""During Israel's war for independence England allied with their Arab neighbors to fight the Israeli rebels.""]","Answer: True

Justification: The context provided indicates that England was directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is evidenced by the fact that England occupied what is now Israel until 1945 and during Israel's war for independence, England allied with the Arab neighbors to fight the Israeli rebels. This direct involvement in the conflict supports the statement that England was indeed directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict.",True
Did Alice's Adventures in Wonderland inspire Macbeth?,"[""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published in 1865"", 'Macbeth was first performed in 1606']","Answer: False

Explanation: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published in 1865, while Macbeth was first performed in 1606. Since Macbeth predates Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by over 250 years, it cannot have been inspired by the latter.",False
Could Quartz be useful to humans if plants died off and there was no oxygen?,"['Plants produce oxygen which is needed by humans to survive.', 'Quartz is a hard mineral substance made of several elements.', 'Quartz is composed of silicon and oxygen.', 'Quartz can be melted at high temperatures.']","False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that plants produce oxygen, which is essential for human survival. If plants died off and there was no oxygen, humans would not be able to survive. Quartz, despite being a mineral that can be melted at high temperatures, does not produce oxygen or provide a substitute for the oxygen needed by humans. Therefore, Quartz would not be useful to humans in a scenario where plants died off and there was no oxygen.",True
Is the Asian black bear multicolored?,"['The Asian black bear is an animal that lives in habitats with trees.', 'Multicolored refers to anything that is composed of more than one color.', 'The Sian black bear has a black coat with a white V-shaped patch.']","Answer: True

Does Robert De Niro use a microscope at work?,"['A microscope is a tool used by scientists.', 'Robert De Niro works on movies and television shows, and he is not a scientist.']","False

Explanation: The context states that a microscope is a tool used by scientists, and Robert De Niro works in the entertainment industry, not as a scientist. Therefore, it is unlikely that he uses a microscope at work.",False
Does Homer Simpson need two hands worth of fingers to count to 5?,"['Homer Simpson is a character of the long running comedy animated series ""The Simpsons"".', 'All characters in ""The Simpsons"" have 4 fingers on each hand.']","Answer: False

Justification: According to the context, Homer Simpson, like all characters in ""The Simpsons"", has 4 fingers on each hand. Therefore, he has a total of 8 fingers. To count to 5, he would only need one hand, as 5 is less than the total number of fingers he has (8). Thus, the statement that he needs two hands worth of fingers to count to 5 is false.",True
Would Gordon Ramsey use uranium as a seasoning?,"['Gordon Ramsey is a chef known for producing high quality food ', 'Uranium is a toxic and weakly radioactive metal']","False

Justification: 
1. Gordon Ramsey is a chef known for producing high quality food, which implies he uses safe and edible ingredients.
2. Uranium is a toxic and weakly radioactive metal, making it unsuitable and unsafe for use as a seasoning in food.",False
Does open heart surgery finish before entirety of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake?,"[""The American Ballet theatre's Swan Lake has a run time of 145 minutes."", 'The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute states that a coronary artery bypass takes 3 to 6 hours']","False

Reasoning: 
1. The American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake has a run time of 145 minutes, which is approximately 2.4 hours.
2. Open heart surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass, takes 3 to 6 hours.

Since open heart surgery takes longer than the run time of Swan Lake, it is not guaranteed that the surgery would finish before the entirety of the ballet performance.",False
Can United States Secretary of State do crimes in U.K. without being arrested?,"['Diplomatic Immunity allows for diplomats in other countries to not be tried for their transgressions.', 'Countries that signed the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations allow for Diplomatic Immunity.', 'All UN member states besides Palau, The Solomon Islands, and South Sudan have signed the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations treaty.', 'The U.K. is one of the original UN member nations.']","False

The answer is False because, while the United States Secretary of State may have some diplomatic immunity due to their position, it does not grant them complete immunity to commit crimes without consequences in the U.K. or any other country. Diplomatic immunity is generally limited to actions performed as part of their official duties and does not cover serious crimes or personal misconduct. Additionally, the U.K. and the U.S. are both signatories to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which outlines the limitations of diplomatic immunity. If a U.S. Secretary of State were to commit a crime in the U.K., it would likely be a matter of diplomatic negotiation and could result in the individual being declared ""persona non grata"" and expelled from the country, or in some cases, facing legal proceedings.",True
Are pirate lieutenants like navy lieutenants?,"['Lieutenant Richards was a pirate that sailed alongside Blackbeard.', ""Lieutenant RIchards had many duties and was placed in charge of the ship, Bonnet's Revenge."", 'In the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies, the second-in-command of a vessel is known as the first lieutenant.', 'Royal Navy lieutenants are in charge of other crew members and have many duties.']","Answer: True

Justification: The context provided indicates that both pirate lieutenants and navy lieutenants have significant responsibilities and command roles within their respective groups. Lieutenant Richards, a pirate, was in charge of the ship Bonnet's Revenge, similar to how a first lieutenant in the Royal Navy would be the second-in-command and have many duties. This similarity in roles and responsibilities suggests that pirate lieutenants are indeed similar to navy lieutenants in terms of their position and tasks.",True
Should a finished website have lorem ipsum paragraphs?,"['Lorem Ipsum paragraphs are meant to be temporary.', 'Web designers always remove lorem ipsum paragraphs before launch.']","False

Explanation: According to the context, Lorem Ipsum paragraphs are temporary and are always removed by web designers before launching a website. Therefore, a finished website should not have Lorem Ipsum paragraphs.",False
Is Rand Paul guilty of catch-phrase used to attack John Kerry in 2004?,"['John Kerry was attacked by his opponents in the 2004 Presidential Campaign by being called a Flip-Flopper.', 'A Flip-Flopper is someone that makes a complete change in policy from one thing to another.', 'In May 2010 Rand Paul called for an electronic fence to keep out immigrants and deplored amnesty in any form.', 'In 2013 Rand Paul said he was in favor of undocumented immigrants being granted  legal status.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Rand Paul is guilty of using a catch-phrase similar to the one used to attack John Kerry in 2004. In 2004, John Kerry was called a ""Flip-Flopper"" for changing his policy positions. Rand Paul initially called for an electronic fence and opposed amnesty in 2010, but later in 2013, he supported granting legal status to undocumented immigrants. This change in policy positions can be seen as a ""flip-flop,"" similar to the label used against John Kerry.",True
Would Jacques Duèze have been friends with Richard Dawkins?,"['Jacques Duèze was later Pope John XXII.', 'The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, a Christian organization.', 'Christianity is a religion.', 'Richard Dawkins is a prominent critic of religion.']","False

Explanation: Given the context, Jacques Duèze, as Pope John XXII, was a prominent figure in the Catholic Church, which is a Christian organization.

Was Robert Downey Jr. a good role model as a young man?,"['As a young man, Robert Downey Jr. struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.', 'Robert Downey Jr. shot a gun out of a car window while doing drugs as a young adult.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Robert Downey Jr. had significant struggles with drug and alcohol addiction as a young man, including dangerous behavior like shooting a gun out of a car window while under the influence.

Explanation: According to the context, it would take approximately 125 days to binge watch the entire EastEnders TV series. However, a human can only last 4 days without water. Therefore, it is not possible to binge watch the entire series without water, as a person would not survive that long without hydration.",False

Explanation: While it is true that stargazers might prefer binoculars for certain situations, such as wide-field observations or portability, the context does not provide enough information to definitively say that stargazers would prefer binoculars over a telescope. Telescopes are generally more powerful and provide better resolution for detailed observations of celestial objects. Therefore, the answer is false as it cannot be concluded that stargazers would universally prefer binoculars over a telescope.",False
Does the land in close proximity to beaver dams suffer?,"['Beaver dams often lead to flooding in the areas around them.', 'Flooding can lead to loosening of the soil.', 'Loosened soil can cause trees to fall over. ', 'Flooding can lead to soil erosion.']","Answer: True

Explanation: In the context provided, the 1980 United States presidential election cannot be considered a photo finish.

In a tug of war, the side with more people would generally have a higher chance of winning.

Did Bill Gates achieve Latin honors?,"['Bill Gates left Harvard after two years.', 'Latin honors are Latin phrases used in some colleges and universities to indicate the level of distinction with which an academic degree has been earned.', 'You cannot earn an academic degree if you drop out of the program.']","False

Explanation: According to the context, Bill Gates left Harvard after two years, which means he did not complete his academic degree.

"Would Mary, mother of Jesus have hypothetically prayed to Artemis if she was Greek?","['Mary, Mother of Jesus is known for being a virgin and giving birth to Christ.', 'Artemis was the Greek goddess of the hunt, childbirth, and virgins.']","Answer: True

Explanation: If Mary, mother of Jesus, were Greek, she might have been inclined to pray to Artemis, as Artemis was the Greek goddess associated with childbirth and virgins.

Explanation: According to the context, the surface temperatures on Phobos range from about −4 °C (25 °F) on the sunlit side to −112 °C (−170 °F) on the shadowed side. Since a coat is a garment used to keep a person warm, and the temperatures on Phobos are extremely cold, it would be necessary to wear a coat when on Phobos to maintain warmth and protect oneself from the cold temperatures.",True

Is shrimp prevalent in Ethiopian cuisine?,"['Ethiopian cuisine specializes in vegetables and spicy meat dishes.', 'Ethiopia is a landlocked country without access to seas or oceans.']","Answer: False

Justification: Given the context, Ethiopia is a landlocked country without access to seas or oceans.

Do suburbs encourage the use of cars?,"['Suburbs are generally built outside of walking distance from city centers.', 'City centers contain jobs and stores.', 'Suburb dwellers need to access jobs and stores to survive.']","Answer: True

Justification: The context provided indicates that suburbs are typically located outside of walking distance from city centers, which contain essential resources such as jobs and stores. Since suburb dwellers need to access these resources to survive, and the distance between suburbs and city centers makes walking impractical, it is reasonable to conclude that suburbs encourage the use of cars as the primary mode of transportation to access these necessities.",True
Could one Amazon share ever buy twenty year Netflix subscription?,"['Amazon stock has reached as high as $2,500 a share as of June 2020.', 'The basic Netflix subscription package costs $8.99 a month as of 2020.']","False

Explanation: To calculate if one Amazon share could buy a twenty-year Netflix subscription, we need to determine the total cost of the subscription and compare it to the value of one Amazon share.

The total cost of a twenty-year Netflix subscription at $8.99 per month is:
$8.99 * 12 months * 20 years = $2,157.60

As of June 2020, one Amazon share was valued at $2,500. Since the cost of the twenty-year Netflix subscription ($2,157.60) is less than the value of one Amazon share ($2,500), one Amazon share could indeed buy a twenty-year Netflix subscription. However, the answer is ""False"" because the question asks if it ""could ever"" buy the subscription, implying that there might be a time when the share price is lower than the subscription cost, which is possible given the fluctuations in stock prices.",True
Can pancreas removal cause bankruptcy?,"['Pancreas removal is a medical procedure.', 'Medical procedures are expensive in come countries. ', 'Expensive procedures can cause debt.', 'Debt can cause bankruptcy. ']","True

Can you worship Ahura Mazda at a mosque?,"['Ahura Mazda is a deity in Zoroastrianism', 'A mosque is a place of worship for Muslims']","Answer: False

Explanation: Ahura Mazda is a deity in Zoroastrianism, which is a different religion from Islam. A mosque is a place of worship specifically for Muslims, who follow Islam and worship Allah.

Is Gandalf hypothetically a formidable foe for Charmed's Barbas?,"['Gandalf was a wizard in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series.', 'Gandalf used his staff to cast powerful spells.', 'Barbas was a demon on Charmed that had resistance to magic.']","Answer: True

Justification:
1. Gandalf is a powerful wizard with extensive knowledge and abilities in magic, as seen in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series.
2. Gandalf's use of his staff to cast powerful spells demonstrates his capability in combat and magical prowess.
3. Although Barbas has resistance to magic, Gandalf's vast experience and skills in magic could potentially allow him to overcome Barbas' resistance and pose a formidable challenge for the demon.",False
Would a moose hypothetically be too much for a minotaur to devour whole?,"['A minotaur was a mythological beast with the head of a bull and body of a human.', 'Human stomachs process about three to four pounds of food a day.', 'A moose can weigh up to 1500 pounds.', 'Bulls can consume around 33 pounds of food a day.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Given the context, a moose weighs up to 1500 pounds, which is significantly larger than the amount of food a human or a bull can consume in a day.

Therefore, it is hypothetically true that a moose would be too much for a minotaur to devour whole.",True
Does Fraktur have a sordid history?,"['Fraktur is a type of font that originated in Germany.', 'Fraktur was used on official Nazi documents.', ""Fraktur was used on the cover of Hitler's Mein Kampf.""]","True

Explanation: The context provided indicates that ""Puzzle Place"" aired on PBS between 1995 and 1998, while ""Naruto"" aired on Cartoon Network in 2005. These are two different channels, so it would not be possible to watch both shows on the same channel at the same time.",False

Explanation: The Andes are located in South America, while the Colossus of Rhodes was in ancient Greece. Given the geographical distance between the two locations, the peak of the Andes would have been hidden from the view of the Colossus of Rhodes. Additionally, even if they were closer, the height of the Andes (almost 23,000 feet) would still be significantly higher than the Colossus of Rhodes (108 feet), making it impossible for the Colossus to see the peak of the Andes.",True
Is LG Electronics located in a city with an official bird that has a purplish/blue tail?,"['LG Electronics is headquarted in Seoul.', 'The official bird of Seoul is the Korean magpie.', 'The Korean magpie has a purplish/blue colored tail.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Binary numbers only contain 0 and 1, and the standard alphabet contains only letters without special characters.

Will twenty pea pods contents cover entire chess board?,"['Pea pods on average have 5 to 6 peas inside.', 'A standard chess board has 64 squares.']","Answer: False

Explanation: To determine if twenty pea pods can cover an entire chess board, we need to calculate the total number of peas and compare it to the number of squares on the chess board.

1. If each pea pod has an average of 5 to 6 peas, then twenty pea pods would contain approximately 20 * (5 to 6) = 100 to 120 peas.
2. A standard chess board has 64 squares.

Since the total number of peas (100 to 120) is less than the number of squares on the chess board (64), it is not possible for the peas to cover the entire chess board. Therefore, the answer is False.",True

For example, if one twin is born right before the New Year and the other is born right after the New Year, they would technically have different birth years. Additionally, with the use of IVF, twins can be born decades apart, further demonstrating that twins are not always born during the same year.",False
Would WWF be angrier if you killed koala instead of black swan?,"['The WWF is an international organization that works for the preservation of animals.', 'Black swans are designated as least concern species meaning they are not close to being endangered.', 'Koalas are designated as  vulnerable to extinction—just a step above endangered.']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context provided, the WWF is an organization dedicated to the preservation of animals. Koalas are classified as vulnerable to extinction, which is a more critical status than the black swan's designation as least concern. Therefore, the WWF would likely be more concerned and potentially angrier if a koala were killed, as it is a species that is closer to being endangered and in greater need of protection.",True
Would a clouded leopard encounter an awake pangolin?,"['Pangolins and clouded leopards have an overlap of ranges', 'Pangolins are nocturnal', 'Clouded leopards are nocturnal']","Answer: True

Could a nymph tick pass through a standard hole punch?,"['A nymph tick is the size of a poppy seed.', 'A poppy seed is around 1mm in size.', 'The ISO 838 standards set a hole punch size at 6 mm.']","False

Explanation: The context states that a nymph tick is the size of a poppy seed, which is around 1mm in size. The ISO 838 standards set a hole punch size at 6 mm. Since the nymph tick is significantly smaller than the hole punch size, it could pass through a standard hole punch. However, the answer is marked as ""True"" in the question, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be ""False"" because the nymph tick is small enough to pass through the hole punch.",True
Did The Who have to cancel tours due to World War II?,"['The Who was formed in 1964', 'World War II ended in 1945']","Answer: False

Explanation: The Who was formed in 1964, which is well after World War II ended in 1945. Therefore, they could not have had to cancel tours due to World War II.",False
Has numerology helped shape hotel layouts?,"['Numerology is the study of numbers and how they relate to events.', 'Numbers such as 3 and 7 hold biblical significance.', 'Numbers such as 6 and 13 are said to be unlucky.', 'The thirteenth floor is a designation of a level of a multi-level building that is often omitted in countries where the number 13 is considered unlucky.', 'Many hotels do not have thirteenth floors because of the enduring superstition.']","Answer: True

Explanation: The context provided indicates that numerology, particularly the belief in certain numbers being lucky or unlucky, has influenced hotel layouts. Specifically, the superstition surrounding the number 13 has led many hotels to omit a thirteenth floor. This demonstrates that numerology has indeed helped shape hotel layouts by influencing design decisions based on numerical beliefs.",True

Can an art dealer buy Boeing 737-800 with a Da Vinci painting?,"['The Boeing 737-800 plane costs 106 million dollars in 2019.', 'Salvator Mundi, a painting attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, is the most expensive painting ever sold.', 'Salvator Mundi sold for over 450 million dollars.']","False

Explanation: While the Da Vinci painting, Salvator Mundi, sold for over 450 million dollars, which is more than the cost of a Boeing 737-800 plane, the question asks if an art dealer can buy the plane with the painting. This implies using the painting as a form of payment, which is not a standard or likely transaction. Therefore, the answer is False.",True
Would a crocodile survive longer in Great Salt Lake than alligator?,"['The Great Salt Lake is a Utah lake composed of salt water.', 'Crocodiles natural habitat is salt water and they can breathe underwater for hours.', 'Alligators have a natural habitat of fresh water.']","Answer: True

Reasoning: Based on the context provided, crocodiles have a natural habitat in salt water and can breathe underwater for hours, which would be beneficial in the Great Salt Lake's salt water environment. On the other hand, alligators have a natural habitat of fresh water, which would not be suitable for the Great Salt Lake's salt water. Therefore, it is likely that a crocodile would survive longer in the Great Salt Lake than an alligator.",True
Can chemicals in onion help create a thermonuclear bomb?,"['A thermonuclear bomb, also called a hydrogen bomb, uses hydrogen under high temperatures to create an explosive reaction.', 'While chopping onions, cells inside the onion are broken and the gas that comes out forms sulfenic acid.', 'Sulfenic acid is composed of several elements including hydrogen.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Although sulfenic acid contains hydrogen, the amount and type of hydrogen present in sulfenic acid from onions is not suitable for creating the high-energy explosive reaction required for a thermonuclear bomb. The hydrogen used in thermonuclear bombs is a heavy isotope (deuterium or tritium) and requires specific conditions and materials that are not found in onions. Therefore, the chemicals in onions cannot help create a thermonuclear bomb.",True
Did Operation Barbarossa or Barbarossa's last expedition succeed?,"['Operation Barbarossa was the Nazi advance on Russia during World War II.', 'Operation Barbarossa was a failure that resulted in Nazi Germany being pushed back by a Soviet counter offensive.', 'Operation Barbarossa was named after Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.', 'On his final expedition, Frederick Barbarossa drowned while leading an army to help the Crusaders during the Third Crusade.', 'The Crusaders failed to recapture Jerusalem during the Third Crusade without the support of Barbarossa and his troops.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi advance on Russia during World War II, was a failure as it resulted in Nazi Germany being pushed back by a Soviet counteroffensive. On the other hand, Frederick Barbarossa's last expedition, which ended with his drowning while leading an army to help the Crusaders during the Third Crusade, did not succeed either, as the Crusaders failed to recapture Jerusalem without his support. Therefore, neither Operation Barbarossa nor Barbarossa's last expedition succeeded.",False
Were any of despised Pope Alexander VI's descendants canonized?,"['Pope Alexander the VI was a controversial pope born as Rodrigo Borgia.', 'Rodrigo Borgia had several children including the despised Juan Borgia who was murdered in 1497.', ""Juan Borgia's grandson, Francis Borgia, was a Jesuit priest and the third Superior General of the Society of Jesus."", 'Canonization is the process by which the Catholic Church names someone a saint.', 'Francis Borgia was named a Catholic saint in June 1670.']","Answer: True

Explanation: While Saturn is indeed named after the Roman god Saturn, who is derived from the Greek equivalent Kronos, Kronos was not the king of the gods in Greek mythology. The king of the gods in Greek mythology was Zeus, who was Kronos's son. Therefore, Saturn is not named after the king of gods in Greek mythology, as that title belongs to Zeus, not Kronos.",False
Would it be difficult to snowboard on Venus?,"['Snowboarding involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard.', 'Snow is formed by the freezing of water.', 'Water has a freezing point of 32°F.', 'Venus has a mean surface temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F).']","Answer: True

Explanation: Based on the context provided:
1. Snowboarding requires snow, which is formed by the freezing of water.
2. Water freezes at 32°F.
3. Venus has a mean surface temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), which is well above the freezing point of water.

Is there any absolute way to prevent abortion?,"['In areas where professional medical abortions are illegal, women get unsafe illegal abortions from unlicensed practitioners. ', 'Women have successfully aborted their own children through physical or chemical means for centuries.']","False

Explanation: While it is possible to regulate or restrict access to abortions through laws and policies, there is no absolute way to completely prevent abortions. As mentioned in the context, even when professional medical abortions are illegal, women may still seek unsafe, illegal methods to terminate pregnancies. Additionally, history shows that women have found ways to abort pregnancies through various means despite legal or societal restrictions. Therefore, it is not possible to completely prevent abortions under all circumstances.",False

Justification: Based on the context provided, we can compare the number of murders charged to Charles Manson and Richard Ramirez. Charles Manson was charged with 9 counts of murder, while Richard Ramirez, whose name was combined with a model to form the name of a Marilyn Manson band member, was charged with 13 counts of murder. Since Richard Ramirez has a higher number of murder charges than Charles Manson, it is true that a Marilyn Manson band member was named for someone who exceeded Charles Manson's kills.",True

Would Topa Inca Yupanqui have encountered the western honey bee?,"['Topa Inca Yupanqui was an Inca ruler in the 15th century', 'Western honey bees were first introduced to the Americas in the 16th century']","Answer: False

Justification: According to the context, Topa Inca Yupanqui was an Inca ruler in the 15th century, while the western honey bee was first introduced to the Americas in the 16th century. Since Topa Inca Yupanqui lived before the introduction of the western honey bee, he would not have encountered it.",False
Can shooting bald eagle get a person more prison time than Michael Vick?,"['Michael Vick spent 21 months in prison for an illegal dog fighting ring.', 'Shooting a bald eagle carries a penalty of up to two years in prison for a second conviction.']","False

Explanation: According to the context, shooting a bald eagle carries a penalty of up to two years in prison for a second conviction. Michael Vick spent 21 months in prison, which is approximately 1.75 years. Since the maximum prison time for shooting a bald eagle is two years, it is possible for a person to receive more prison time than Michael Vick for this offense. However, the context does not provide information on whether a first conviction for shooting a bald eagle would result in more prison time than Michael Vick's sentence. Therefore, the answer is False.",True

Is zoology unconcerned with strigoi?,"['Zoology is the study of the behavior and classification of animals.', 'Strigoi are spirits that can transform into animals in Romanian mythology.', 'Zoology is based on science and fossils.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While zoology is primarily concerned with the study of animals based on science and fossils, the context mentions that strigoi are spirits that can transform into animals in Romanian mythology. This suggests that strigoi, as a mythological concept, might not be a direct subject of study in zoology, which focuses on empirical evidence and scientific classification of animals. However, the statement ""zoology is unconcerned with strigoi"" is too absolute, as zoology could potentially study folklore or mythological aspects of animals as part of cultural or historical contexts, even if not directly within its core scientific scope. Therefore, the answer is ""False"" because it is not entirely accurate to say that zoology is unconcerned with strigoi, even though it might not be a primary focus.",True
Is Jesse W. Moore a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA?,"['Snoopy has been a mascot of safety in NASA', 'The Silver Snoopy award is given by NASA astronauts to employees and contractors for outstanding achievements related to flight safety ', 'Jesse W. Moore received warnings about the failure history of the O rings used on the Challenger shuttle, but did not act on them', ""Jesse W. Moore was the associate administrator in charge of NASA's shuttle program at the time of the Challenger explosion"", 'The O rings were strongly implicated in the fatal explosion']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Jesse W. Moore was in a position of responsibility at NASA during the Challenger shuttle disaster, and he received warnings about the failure history of the O rings used on the shuttle but did not act on them. Given that the Silver Snoopy award is given for outstanding achievements related to flight safety, and considering the role of the O rings in the Challenger explosion, it is unlikely that Jesse W. Moore would be a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA. Instead, his actions (or lack thereof) regarding the safety warnings would more likely disqualify him from receiving such an award.",False

Can bottlenose dolphins hypothetically outbreed human women?,"['Bottlenose dolphins have a gestation period of 12 months.', 'Human women have a gestation period around 9 months.']","False

Explanation: The question asks if bottlenose dolphins can hypothetically outbreed human women. The context provided states that bottlenose dolphins have a gestation period of 12 months and human women have a gestation period of around 9 months. However, this information alone does not determine the ability of bottlenose dolphins to outbreed human women, as it does not consider other factors such as fertility rates, lifespan, and the ability to interbreed, which is not possible between humans and dolphins due to biological differences. Therefore, based on the given context, the answer is False.",False

Explanation: The context states that Paulo Coelho's wife, Christina Oiticica, is a Brazilian artist who makes a living through drawing, which is done by her hands.

Would Robert Stack have been interested in Tower of London during 1400s for his 14 season show?,"['Robert Stack was an actor best known for Unsolved Mysteries which lasted for 14 seasons before being rebooted by Netflix.', 'The Tower of London is a historic building in London.', 'Unsolved Mysteries explored unexplained phenomenon and mysterious events.', 'The heirs of Edward IV mysteriously vanished from the Tower of London in the 1400s and were presumed muredered.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Given the context, Robert Stack's show, Unsolved Mysteries, focused on unexplained phenomena and mysterious events. The disappearance of the heirs of Edward IV from the Tower of London in the 1400s is a historical mystery that aligns with the show's theme. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Robert Stack would have been interested in this historical event for his 14-season show.",True
Are months based on the solar cycle?,"[""The solar cycle is measured by the year: the length of one orbit, as well as by day: the length of one of Earth's rotation about its axis."", 'However, months are based on the lunar cycle, how the shadow of the Earth on the moon causes it to appear to grow and shrink and change shape over the course of four weeks.']","Answer: False

Justification: The context states that months are based on the lunar cycle, not the solar cycle. The lunar cycle refers to the phases of the moon as it orbits the Earth, which takes approximately 29.5 days to complete. This is the basis for the length of a month in many calendars, including the Gregorian calendar. The solar cycle, on the other hand, is related to the Earth's orbit around the sun and the rotation of the Earth on its axis, which determine the length of a day and a year, not a month. Therefore, the statement that months are based on the solar cycle is incorrect.",False
"Would a 900,000 pound net worth person be an American billionaire if they exchange currency June 2020?","['The exchange rate in June of 2020 between dollars and pounds is 1 Euro= 1.23 dollar.', '900000 pounds is equal to about 1,107,000.00']","False

Explanation: The context provided states that the exchange rate in June 2020 between dollars and pounds is 1 Euro = 1.23 dollar. However, this is incorrect as the exchange rate should be between pounds and dollars, not euros. Assuming the correct exchange rate is 1 pound = 1.23 dollars, then 900,000 pounds would be equal to approximately 1,107,000 dollars. This amount does not make the person a billionaire, as a billionaire is defined as someone with a net worth of at least one billion dollars. Therefore, the answer is False.",True

Explanation: While Ramjit Raghav did have a child at age 94, Tony Bennett would be turning 94 in August 2020, which means he was born in 1926. Ancient Tony Bennett, referring to a younger version of him in the past, could not have a baby in 2020 as he would not be present in that time period.",True

Justification:
1. Immersion Baptism involves submerging people underwater, which inherently carries a risk of drowning if not performed safely.

Additionally, airports in the US are required to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which allows for service dogs, including German Shepherds, to accompany individuals as medical equipment. Furthermore, some airlines offer special travel accommodations for dogs. Therefore, a German Shepherd would likely be welcome in an airport under these conditions.",True

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Hodor was a character with limited intellectual capabilities, as he was described as dimwitted and could only say his own name. Mathematicians require a high level of cognitive ability, including the ability to read, write, and understand complex mathematical theories.

Do people with mood disorders need permanent institutionalization?,"['Most mood disorders can be treated in the outpatient setting.', 'Many people with mood disorders do not get diagnosed at all.']","Answer: False

Justification: The context provided indicates that most mood disorders can be treated in the outpatient setting, which implies that permanent institutionalization is not a necessary requirement for people with mood disorders. The statement that many people with mood disorders do not get diagnosed at all further supports the idea that institutionalization is not the standard or only treatment option. Therefore, the claim that people with mood disorders need permanent institutionalization is not supported by the context.",False
Did Johann Sebastian Bach influence heavy metal?,"['Johann Sebastian Bach was a classical German composer born in 1685.', 'Lead singer of heavy metal band Skid Row, Sebastian Bach, took his name from German composer Johann Sebastian Bach.', 'Heavy Metal band Metallica released a live album with the San Francisco Symphony.', 'Deep Purple, n English hard rock/heavy metal band has cited classical musicians as their inspiration.', 'Deep Purple\'s keyboard and guitar solos on ""Highway Star,"" have been called Bach-like in harmonic progression and virtuosic arpeggio figuration.']","Answer: True

Justification: While Johann Sebastian Bach himself did not directly influence the creation of heavy metal music, his work and style have been cited as an inspiration by some heavy metal bands and musicians. Deep Purple's keyboard and guitar solos on ""Highway Star"" have been called Bach-like, and the lead singer of Skid Row took his name from the composer. Additionally, the collaboration between Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony shows that classical music elements can be incorporated into heavy metal. Therefore, it can be concluded that Bach's influence can be seen in the genre of heavy metal.",True

Can Poland Spring make money in the Sahara?,"['The Sahara is the largest hot desert', 'Deserts are dry regions that receive little precipitation', 'Poland Spring sells bottled water']","Answer: False

Reasoning: The context provided indicates that the Sahara is a large hot desert, which is characterized by its dryness and lack of precipitation. Since Poland Spring sells bottled water, which is typically sourced from areas with abundant water resources, it would be challenging for them to make money in the Sahara due to the scarcity of water in the region. Therefore, the statement that Poland Spring can make money in the Sahara is likely false.",True
Did Malcolm X avoid eating ham?,"['Malcolm X was a practicing Muslim', 'Muslims are prohibited from eating foods derived from pigs']","Answer: True

Would a snakebite hypothetically be a threat to T-1000?,"['Snakebites are dangerous because they inject venom into blood streams.', 'The T-1000 is an android from the movie series Terminator.', 'Androids are machines made of wires and computer parts.']","False

Explanation: The T-1000 is an android, which means it is a machine made of non-biological materials such as wires and computer parts. Since it does not have a biological bloodstream, a snakebite would not be a threat to it as the venom would have no effect on its mechanical components.",False
Could the Powepuff Girls make the background to the Azerbaijani flag?,"['The national flag of the Republic of Azerbaijan is a horizontal tricolour featuring three equally sized fesses of blue, red, and green', 'Each of the Powerpuff Girls creates a trail of a different color when she flies: Bubbles makes blue, Blossom makes red, and Buttercup makes green.']","True

Justification:
1. The Azerbaijani flag consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes of blue, red, and green.
2. Each of the Powerpuff Girls creates a trail of a different color when she flies, with Bubbles making blue, Blossom making red, and Buttercup making green.

Given these facts, the Powerpuff Girls could potentially align their color trails to create the background of the Azerbaijani flag, as their colors match the required colors and arrangement.",True
Are black and white prison uniforms made to resemble a zebra?,"['Prison stripes are made of parallel lines.', 'Zebra stripes are jagged in appearance. ']","False

Explanation: The context states that prison stripes are made of parallel lines, while zebra stripes are jagged in appearance. This indicates that the design of prison uniforms is not intended to resemble a zebra, as their stripes are different in style.",False

Justification: Given the context, Bacchus, as the Roman god of wine and revelry, would likely enjoy a holiday that involves drinking and celebration. New Year's Eve, with its tradition of drinking a toast and being the biggest day for liquor store sales, aligns with Bacchus's domain.

Is immersion in virtual reality testable on cnidarians before humans?,"['Perceptions are interpreted in the brain via the nervous system', 'Hypothetical ways of interfacing with the central nervous system are being explored for immersive virtual reality', 'Cnidarians have a nervous system, but not a central nervous system']","False

Explanation: The context states that perceptions are interpreted in the brain via the nervous system and that immersive virtual reality interfaces are being explored for the central nervous system. Cnidarians, however, do not have a central nervous system, which is necessary for interpreting perceptions in the way required for immersive virtual reality. Therefore, immersion in virtual reality cannot be tested on cnidarians before humans due to the lack of a central nervous system in cnidarians.",False
Can you carry a Chrysler in a laptop bag?,"['Chrysler manufactures automobiles, which weigh several thousand pounds', 'Laptop bags are designed to hold laptop computers, which typically weigh under ten pounds']","Answer: False

Justification: The context provided indicates that Chrysler manufactures automobiles, which are significantly large and heavy, weighing several thousand pounds.

Explanation: Based on the context provided, a bodybuilder would not enjoy wearing a cast for several weeks. This is because casts prevent limb movement, which is necessary for muscle growth, a key goal in bodybuilding. The absence of limb movement would lead to decreased muscle size, and individuals are generally not happy when they are prevented from pursuing their goals.",False
Is Home Depot a one stop shop for crucifixion supplies?,"['A one stop shop is a store where multiple items are supplied.', 'Crucifixion is a form of punishment in which a person is nailed to a wooden cross.', 'Home Depot sells numerous supplies including: hammers, nails, and wood.']","True

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Home Depot sells various supplies including hammers, nails, and wood, which are materials that could potentially be used for crucifixion. Although crucifixion is not a common or legal form of punishment today, and Home Depot does not specifically advertise these supplies for that purpose, the store does sell items that could be used for such an act. Therefore, it can be considered a one stop shop for crucifixion supplies in a hypothetical sense.",True
Would Temujin hypothetically be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests?,"['Temujin was the birth name of Genghis Khan.', 'Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire which was the largest land empire in world history.', 'Charlemagne, King of the Franks, conquered most of Western Europe.', 'At its peak, the Mongol Empire had 110 million people.', ""Charlemagne's empire had around 20 million people at its height.""]","False

Reasoning: Given the context, Temujin (Genghis Khan) founded the Mongol Empire, which was the largest land empire in world history and had 110 million people at its peak. In comparison, Charlemagne's empire had around 20 million people at its height. Since Genghis Khan's empire was significantly larger and more extensive, it is unlikely that he would be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests.",False
Is the Holy Land important to Eastern religions?,"['Eastern religions include Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism.', 'Hinduism recognizes seven Holy Cities which are Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Varanasi, Kanchipuram, Dvaraka and Ujjain.', 'Bodh Gaya: (in the current Mahabodhi Temple, Bihar, India), is the most important religious site and place of pilgrimage for Buddhists.', 'The most sacred Shinto shrine is located in the city of Ise, within the Shima Peninsula of Japan.']","False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that the Holy Land, which is primarily associated with the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), is not specifically important to Eastern religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism. These Eastern religions have their own significant holy sites and places of pilgrimage, as mentioned in the context (Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Varanasi, Kanchipuram, Dvaraka, Ujjain for Hinduism; Bodh Gaya for Buddhism; and Ise for Shintoism). Therefore, the Holy Land is not a significant religious site for Eastern religions.",False
Would a human following a hyena diet be unwelcome at a vegan festival?,"['A hyena is a carnivorous mammal that feeds on the flesh of other animals.', 'Vegans are people that stick to a strict diet that does not include animals or animal products.']","Answer: True

Justification: Since a hyena is a carnivorous mammal that feeds on the flesh of other animals, a human following a hyena diet would be consuming meat and other animal products. Vegans, on the other hand, adhere to a strict diet that excludes all animal products. Therefore, a human following a hyena diet would be unwelcome at a vegan festival due to the conflict in dietary choices.",True

Reasoning: Natalie Portman resumed her vegan diet in 2018 and has been vegan since then. Since Snickers contains egg whites, which are an animal product, a vegan would avoid consuming it. Therefore, it is likely that 2019 Natalie Portman would avoid a Snickers bar due to her vegan diet.",True
Do mollymawks live where albatrosses cannot?,"['A mollymawk is a type of albatross', 'Any place inaccessible to albatrosses in general is inaccessible to specific types of albatross']","Answer: False

Is it normal to see a red panda in Shanghai outside of a zoo?,"['The red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas, and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east.', 'The red panda lives between 2,200 and 4,800 m (7,200 and 15,700 ft) altitude, inhabiting areas of moderate temperature between 10 and 25 °C (50 and 77 °F) with little annual change.', 'Shanghai is located on an alluvial plain, as such the vast majority of its land area is flat, with an average elevation of 4 m (13 ft).']","Answer: False

Explanation: The red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas and lives at high altitudes between 2,200 and 4,800 m (7,200 and 15,700 ft). Shanghai, on the other hand, is a flat alluvial plain with an average elevation of 4 m (13 ft), which is not within the natural habitat range of the red panda. Therefore, it is not normal to see a red panda in Shanghai outside of a zoo.",False
Are most mall Santa Claus actors white?,"['In 2016, a black man playing Santa Claus at the Mall of America made national headlines.', 'There are map websites dedicated to locating black Santa Claus mall actors.']","Answer: False

Can DRL Racer X drone get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds?,"['The Brooklyn Bridge is 1.1 miles long.', 'The DRL Racer X drone can fly at a top speed of 179.6 MPH.', 'The DRL Racer X drone can cover around 3 miles a minute.']","Answer: True

Explanation: To determine if the DRL Racer X drone can get across the Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds, we need to calculate the time it takes for the drone to cover the bridge's length.

1. The Brooklyn Bridge is 1.1 miles long.
2. The DRL Racer X drone can fly at a top speed of 179.6 MPH, which is approximately 3 miles per minute (179.6 / 60 ≈ 3).

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the drone to cover the bridge's length:

1.1 miles / 3 miles per minute = 0.3667 minutes

To convert this time to seconds:

0.3667 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 22 seconds

Since the drone can cover the bridge's length in 22 seconds, it is not possible for it to cross the bridge in 18 seconds. Therefore, the answer is False.",False

Explanation: According to the context, Medieval English lords did not engage in fair trade with peasants. The peasants were indentured servants with few rights, were unpaid, and had to ask their lord for permission to marry. This indicates an unequal and unfair relationship, not a fair trade system where fair prices are paid to the producers.",False
Do astronomers write horoscopes?,"['Astronomer study the actual science of the stars.', 'Horoscopes are written by astrologers, not astronomers.']","Answer: False

Can you listen to the entire Itunes song catalog in one year?,"['Itunes has around 43 million songs as of 2017.', 'The average length of a song is 3 minutes.', 'There are 525,600 minutes in a year.']","Answer: False

Explanation: To determine if you can listen to the entire iTunes song catalog in one year, we need to calculate the total time required to listen to all songs and compare it to the total available minutes in a year.

1. Total songs in iTunes catalog: 43 million
2. Average length of a song: 3 minutes

Total time required to listen to all songs = 43,000,000 songs * 3 minutes/song = 129,000,000 minutes

Available minutes in a year: 525,600 minutes

Since 129,000,000 minutes (total time required) is much greater than 525,600 minutes (available in a year), it is not possible to listen to the entire iTunes song catalog in one year. Therefore, the answer is False.",False
"If you were at an Apple store, would most of the computers be running Ubuntu?","['Apple stores stock only Mac brand computers.', 'Mac computers come preinstalled with the latest iOS.']","Answer: False

Justification: According to the context provided, Hindus are allowed to eat any food besides beef, as cows are sacred in their religion.

Is being 5 year Capital One Venture member more cost effective than being in Church of Satan?,"['The Capital One Venture card has an annual fee of around $95.', 'The Church of Satan has a one time lifetime membership fee of $225.']","Answer: True

Explanation: To determine which is more cost-effective, we need to calculate the total cost of being a 5-year Capital One Venture member and compare it to the one-time fee of the Church of Satan.

For Capital One Venture:
- Annual fee: $95
- 5-year membership: 5 * $95 = $475

For Church of Satan:
- One-time lifetime membership fee: $225

- Capital One Venture 5-year cost: $475
- Church of Satan lifetime cost: $225

Since the Church of Satan's lifetime membership fee is lower than the 5-year cost of being a Capital One Venture member, it is more cost-effective. Therefore, the answer is True.",False

Can a human heart last from NYC to Raleigh NC by Toyota Hiux?,"['Human hearts can last up to six hours outside the body.', 'The distance from NYC to Raleigh, NC is 505 miles.', 'The top speed of a Toyota Hilux is 105 MPH.']","False

To answer the question, we need to calculate the time it would take to travel from NYC to Raleigh, NC by Toyota Hilux and compare it to the lifespan of a human heart outside the body.

1. The distance from NYC to Raleigh, NC is 505 miles.
2. The top speed of a Toyota Hilux is 105 MPH.

Using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 505 miles / 105 MPH ≈ 4.81 hours

Would it be possible to fit a football field in Alcatraz Island?,"['Alcatraz is 511 meters by 180 meters', 'A football field is 91 meters by 48 meters']","Answer: True

Explanation: To determine if a football field can fit in Alcatraz Island, we need to compare the dimensions of the island with the dimensions of a football field. 

Alcatraz Island is 511 meters by 180 meters, while a football field is 91 meters by 48 meters.

Justification:
1. Peter Griffin works for Pawtucket Brewery, which is a company that produces beer.

Did Holy Land belong to Adamu's tribe?,"['The Holy Land is a place that Jews, Muslims, and Christians revere.', 'Adamu was an early king of Assyria.', 'The Assyrians were in regions of the Holy Land as far back as 2600 BC.', 'The predecessors to the Assyrians were in regions of the Holy Land as far back as 3500 BC.']","Answer: True

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Adamu was an early king of Assyria, and the Assyrians had a presence in regions of the Holy Land as far back as 2600 BC, with their predecessors being there even earlier, around 3500 BC. This suggests that at some point in history, the Holy Land was part of the territories associated with Adamu's tribe, the Assyrians. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Holy Land did belong to Adamu's tribe.",True
Does the history of Europe include the age of dinosaurs?,"['Dinosaurs went extinct many millions of years ago.', 'In contrast, ancient humans only started recording history several thousand years ago.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context states that dinosaurs went extinct many millions of years ago, and ancient humans only started recording history several thousand years ago. Since the age of dinosaurs predates human history by millions of years, the history of Europe, which is a human-recorded history, does not include the age of dinosaurs.",False

Cookout serves high calorie food, which is generally not conducive to maintaining a slim figure. Therefore, it is unlikely that a model would frequently enjoy the menu at Cookout.",False
Was Edward II crucial to England's victory at Battle of Falkirk?,"['The Battle of Falkirk was a battle between England and the Scots.', 'King Edward I led English forces to victory against William Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk.', 'The Battle of Falkirk took place in 1298.', 'Edward II was born in 1284 and his first campaign with his father against Scotland happened in 1300.', 'Edward II was knighted in 1306.']","False

Explanation: According to the context, Edward II was born in 1284 and his first campaign with his father against Scotland happened in 1300. The Battle of Falkirk took place in 1298, before Edward II's first campaign and before he was knighted in 1306. Therefore, Edward II was not crucial to England's victory at the Battle of Falkirk, as King Edward I led the English forces to victory at that time.",False
Was John George Bice's birthplace near Cornwall?,"['Politician John George Bice was born in Callington.', 'Cornwall is a place located in South West England.', 'Callington is a small town in South East Cornwall.']","Answer: True

Justification:
1. John George Bice was born in Callington.
2. Callington is a small town in South East Cornwall.

Could a markhor give birth three times in a single year?,"['The gestation period of a markhor lasts 135–170 days.', 'There are 365 days in a year.']","False

Explanation: The gestation period of a markhor ranges from 135 to 170 days. Even if a markhor had a gestation period of exactly 135 days, which is the shortest possible, it would still not be able to give birth three times in a single year. The shortest interval between three pregnancies would be 135 days * 3 = 405 days, which is more than the 365 days in a year. Therefore, it is not possible for a markhor to give birth three times in a single year.",False
Would Paul Bunyan hypothetically be a poor choice for an urban planner?,"['Paul Bunyan was a legendary giant from tall tale stories.', 'Urban planners need to design buildings and ceilings in cities.', 'Paul Bunyan lived in the country side with a giant blue ox.', 'New York city apartment ceilings average around 8 feet in height.', 'Paul Bunyan was over seven feet tall.']","Answer: True

Justification: Given the context, Paul Bunyan, being a legendary giant, would likely struggle with the constraints of urban planning, especially in cities like New York where ceiling heights are much lower than his own height. His background in the countryside and lack of experience in designing urban spaces further support the idea that he would be a poor choice for an urban planner.",True
Does the Pixar film Brave feature Scottish people?,"['The movie Brave is set in the Scottish highlands.', 'Merida, the main character of Brave, is a Princess of Medieval Scotland ']","Answer: True

Explanation: The context provided indicates that college students typically submit assignments through email, web portal, or on paper, and that most colleges have on-campus fax machines available for student use. This suggests that owning a personal fax machine is not a common requirement or necessity for college students, as they can use the ones provided by their institutions.

Would a vegetarian be able to eat something at Chick-fil-A?,"[""Most people who follow a vegetarian diet don't eat meat, fish or poultry. "", 'While Chick-fil-A sells chicken, they also offer other items. ', 'Items that are meat free include: hash browns, waffle fries, and superfood sides.']","True

These items do not contain meat, fish, or poultry, which aligns with the dietary restrictions of a vegetarian diet.",True
Did Harry Houdini appear on Chris Angel Mindfreak?,"['Chris Angel Mindfreak was released in 2005.', 'Harry Houdini died in 1926.']","Answer: False

Do Leafhoppers compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources?,"['Leafhoppers are insects that feed on sap from trees.', 'Log Cabin is a  company that originated in Minnesota and makes several varieties of maple syrup.', 'Sap is an ingredient in maple syrup.']","False

Explanation: Leafhoppers and Log Cabin syrup producers do not directly compete for resources. Leafhoppers feed on sap from trees, which is a natural process and not a controlled resource for human consumption. Log Cabin syrup producers harvest sap from maple trees specifically to produce maple syrup. While sap is an ingredient in maple syrup, the process of sap consumption by Leafhoppers does not interfere with or compete with the human production of maple syrup by companies like Log Cabin.",True
Could  jockey win Triple Crown between Eid al-Fitr endpoints?,"['The Triple Crown is an accomplishment in which a jockey wins three specific races.', 'The three Triple Crown races are: Preakness, Kentucky Derby, and Belmont Stakes.', 'The three Triple Crown races take place weeks apart.', 'Eid al-Fitr is a Muslim holiday that lasts for three consecutive days.']","Answer: True

Explanation: The Triple Crown races (Preakness, Kentucky Derby, and Belmont Stakes) take place weeks apart, which means they do not coincide with the three consecutive days of Eid al-Fitr. Therefore, a jockey could potentially win the Triple Crown between the endpoints of Eid al-Fitr, as the timing of the races does not conflict with the holiday.",False
Is purchasing food for a Lolcat unnecessary?,"['An image macro is a piece of digital media featuring a picture, or artwork, superimposed with some form of text.', 'Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.', 'An organism is any individual entity that embodies the properties of life.', 'Digital media does not embody the properties of life.']","Answer: True

Justification: According to the context provided, a Lolcat is an image macro, which is a piece of digital media. Digital media does not embody the properties of life, as stated in point 4. Since a Lolcat is not an organism that requires nutritional support, purchasing food for it would be unnecessary.",True

Reasoning: While a greenhouse is primarily meant for growing plants, it can also contain insects such as aphids, fungus gnats, and caterpillars, which are part of the Common warthog's diet. Therefore, a Common warthog would not necessarily starve in a greenhouse, as it could potentially find insects to eat.",False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, the saltwater crocodile would have an advantage in a hypothetical battle in Lake Urmia, which is a salt lake. The saltwater crocodile has special glands that allow it to survive in salt water, while alligators lack these glands and cannot stay in salt water for extended periods of time. Therefore, it is unlikely that an alligator would best a saltwater crocodile in this scenario.",False
Is Y2K relevant to the plot of The Godfather?,"['The story in the Godfather spans from 1945 to 1955.', 'Y2K refers to events related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning in the year 2000.']","False

Could chives be mistaken for grass?,"['Chives grow upwards in thin green cylindrical shoots. ', 'Grass grows upwards in thin green flat shoots.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Although chives and grass have some similarities in their appearance, such as growing upwards and having green shoots, their shoots have distinct shapes. Chives have thin green cylindrical shoots, while grass has thin green flat shoots. However, due to their similar color and growth pattern, it is possible for someone to mistakenly identify chives as grass, especially if they are not familiar with the specific characteristics of each plant.",True
Does a giant green lady stand in New York Harbor?,"['New York Harbor is a body of water between south Manhattan and the Atlantic Ocean', 'The Statue of Liberty stands in New York Harbor', 'The Statue of Liberty is a very large, green statue of a woman']","True

Explanation: Nancy Pelosi, the only woman to serve as U.S. Speaker of the House, was born on March 26, 1940. The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred on December 7, 1941. Since Nancy Pelosi was already born and alive during the time of the attack, the statement is true.",True

Reasoning: While Mickey Mouse's red shorts and white gloves may blend in with the red and white stripes of the American flag, his large yellow shoes would stand out distinctly against the red, white, and blue background. Therefore, Mickey Mouse would not blend in with the American flag due to the contrasting yellow color of his shoes.",False
Is it dark is Basel during the day in Los Angeles?,"['Basel is located in the CEST time zone.', 'Los Angeles is located in the PDT time zone.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context provided does not directly address the question about whether it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles. However, we can infer the answer based on general knowledge of time zones. Basel (CEST) is typically 9 hours ahead of Los Angeles (PDT).

Can you house a giant squid at Soldier Field?,"['Soldier Field is a football stadium', 'Football fields are 120 yards long, or 360 feet', 'The maximum length of a giant squid is 43 feet']","Answer: True

Justification: Soldier Field, being a football stadium, has dimensions that can accommodate the size of a giant squid. A football field is 360 feet long, and the maximum length of a giant squid is 43 feet. Therefore, it is possible to house a giant squid at Soldier Field as the stadium is significantly larger than the size of the squid.",True
Do Flat Earthers doubt the existence of Earth's magnetic field?,"[""Theories about the Earth's magnetic field depend on the globe model of the Earth."", 'Flat Earthers are skeptical of most science related to the Earth and space, believing it to be part of a conspiracy coverup.']","Answer: True

Explanation: The context provided does not directly address the relationship between the Soviet government and hippie culture. However, it does mention that long hair, associated with hippie culture, was targeted by the state security apparatus in Czechoslovakia during the 1960s and 1970s. This suggests that the government did not encourage or support the hippie culture, but rather monitored and potentially suppressed it. Therefore, the statement that hippie culture was encouraged by the government in the Soviet Union is likely false.",False
Has CNES planted a French flag on the lunar surface?,"['The lunar surface is on the moon.', 'CNES has not sent a person to the moon.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While the atmosphere of Mars contains carbon dioxide, which includes both carbon and oxygen, it does not have sufficient levels of hydrogen in a form that plants could use for photosynthesis. The trace levels of water vapor are not enough to provide the necessary hydrogen. Therefore, not all the elements plants need for photosynthesis are present in the atmosphere of Mars.",True

Justification: While Iris and Hermes are both associated with the role of messengers in Greek mythology, this does not necessarily mean they would struggle at a UPS job.

Does the human stomach destroy a bee if ingested?,"['Bees have an outer protective exoskeleton made of chitin, a polymer of glucose.', 'The human stomach releases harsh acids that break down materials.', 'The human stomach breaks down glucose in about 33 hours.']","False

Explanation: While the human stomach does release harsh acids that can break down materials, the context does not provide enough information to conclude that the stomach can completely destroy a bee if ingested. The exoskeleton of a bee is made of chitin, which is a polymer of glucose, but it is not clear if the stomach acids can break down the chitin structure of the bee's exoskeleton in a way that would ""destroy"" the bee. Additionally, the stomach's ability to break down glucose does not directly relate to its ability to break down the chitin in a bee's exoskeleton.",True

Explanation: The context provided indicates that the Football War was related to a FIFA Cup qualifying match, which is a soccer tournament. Touchdowns are scored in American football, not soccer.

Explanation: The context provided states that Jared Fogle, a former national spokesman for Subway, was found guilty of child molestation and possession of child pornography in 2015. This incident can be considered a pedophilia scandal involving Subway, as Fogle was closely associated with the company.

Therefore, fresh garlic cloves are not as easy to eat as roasted garlic cloves.",False
Is it safe to eat hair?,"['Hair is made of keratin.', 'Food manufacturers use L-cysteine as a food additive.', 'L-cysteine is made from keratin.']","Answer: False

Explanation: While hair is made of keratin and L-cysteine, which is derived from keratin, is used as a food additive, this does not mean it is safe to eat hair directly.

Justification: The context provided indicates that Disney's second film, Pinocchio, features a scene where Gepetto is swallowed by a giant whale. This is similar to the biblical story of the prophet Jonah, who was also swallowed by a whale.

Justification: Jackson Pollock's parents were born and grew up in Tingley, Iowa.

Justification: Given the context, Conan the Barbarian, being a comic book character equipped with a sword and no armor, would be at a significant disadvantage in a modern warfare setting like Call of Duty, where soldiers are equipped with advanced firearms such as sniper rifles, shotguns, and machine guns. His lack of modern weaponry and protective gear would likely lead to a short survival time in such a scenario.",True

Explanation: Although Jackie Chan is proficient in American Sign Language (ASL), which is the predominant sign language used by deaf people in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada, the context does not explicitly state that he would have no trouble communicating with a deaf person. It is implied that he would be able to communicate, but the question asks if he would have trouble, which cannot be definitively answered as ""False"" without additional context about his proficiency or experience using ASL in real-world situations.",False
Is eating a Dicopomorpha echmepterygis size Uranium pellet fatal?,"['Dicopomorpha echmepterygis is a wingless insect that is .13mm large.', 'Uranium is a radioactive element that is dangerous if ingested in large doses.', '25mg of Uranium would cause kidney damage, while 50mg would cause complete kidney failure in humans.']","False

Justification:
1. Dicopomorpha echmepterygis is a very small insect, measuring only 0.13mm in size.
2. Uranium is dangerous if ingested in large doses, but the size of a Uranium pellet relative to the size of the insect is not provided in the context.
3. The context mentions that 25mg of Uranium can cause kidney damage and 50mg can cause complete kidney failure in humans. However, it is not clear if a Uranium pellet of the size that could be consumed by a Dicopomorpha echmepterygis would contain enough Uranium to be fatal.

1. Noah only took his family aboard the Ark.
2. Noah brought his wife, three sons, and his sons' wives.
3. Four couples lived on the Ark, eight total people.

Would a Bengal cat be afraid of catching a fish?,"['Fish live in water. ', 'Many Bengal owners say that their Bengal naturally retrieves items.', 'Bengal cats often enjoy playing in water.']","False

']","False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, a tumulus is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves, which implies the presence of a dead body or bodies. Mars has only been explored by unmanned spacecraft, and while there is evidence that it was once more habitable, it is still unknown if living organisms ever existed there. Therefore, there is no known discovery of a tumulus on Mars, as there is no confirmed evidence of human or animal graves on the planet.",False

However, the context states that League of Legends requires two teams of five players each, meaning a total of 10 players are needed to play the game properly. Even if all 13 members of Cosmic Girls participated, they would not be able to form two complete teams of five players each to play the game alone.",True

', 'Christopher Reeve required a portable ventilator after his injury.', ""At one point, Christopher Reeve's treatment was costing $400,000 yearly.""]","Answer: False

Justification: The question implies that Christopher Reeve's financial status would have affected his survival. However, the context provided indicates that his survival was dependent on medical treatment and equipment, such as a portable ventilator, which was costly. Being poor might have affected his ability to afford this treatment, but it does not directly determine whether he would have lived or not.

Explanation: The context provided does not indicate any relationship between olive oil and the treatment of rabies.

Therefore, the statement that olive oil can kill rabies is false.",False
Can an adult human skull hypothetically pass through the birth canal?,"['The largest baby ever born was 22 pounds. ', 'The average human skull weighs between 10 and 11 pounds.']","False

Explanation: The context provided does not directly address the size of the birth canal in relation to the adult human skull. However, it is known that the birth canal is designed to accommodate the passage of a newborn's head, which is significantly smaller and more flexible than an adult human skull. The largest baby ever born weighing 22 pounds does not necessarily mean the baby's skull was proportionally larger than that of an average baby. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that an adult human skull could pass through the birth canal, as it is much larger and rigid compared to a newborn's skull.",True
Does Ludacris perform classical music?,"['Ludacris is a rap artist.', 'Rap and hip hop music are not related to classical music.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Hafþór Björnsson is significantly taller than Benito Mussolini (6'9"" vs 5'6​1⁄2"").

Would Alexander Graham Bell hypothetically support Nazi eugenics?,"['Eugenics was the idea of selective breeding or sterilization to rid the human populace of certain traits.', 'Nazis used eugenics to justify mass sterilization and mass murder.', 'Alexander Graham Bell Alexander Graham Bell advocated against the use of sign language and hoped to eradicate deafness through selective breeding.']","False

Explanation: While Alexander Graham Bell did advocate for selective breeding to eradicate deafness, this does not necessarily mean he would support Nazi eugenics. The Nazis used eugenics to justify mass sterilization and mass murder, which is a significantly more extreme and morally reprehensible application of the concept.

Do you find glutamic acid in a severed finger?,"['Glutamic acid is an amino acid and neurotransmitter', 'As a neurotransmitter, glutamic acid is the most abundant in the vertebrate nervous system', ""A severed finger contains parts of a vertebrate's nervous system""]","Answer: True

Justification: Given the context, we know that glutamic acid is an amino acid and neurotransmitter, and it is the most abundant in the vertebrate nervous system.

Explanation: The all-time high price of Bitcoin was $19,783, which is higher than the suggested retail price of a 2020 Volkswagen Jetta, which is $18,895. Therefore, at its peak price, a single Bitcoin could cover the cost of a Volkswagen Jetta.",True
Can the original name of the zucchini be typed on the top row of a QWERTY keyboard?,"['The original name for the zucchini in Mexican language or Nahuatl is ayokonetl.', 'The top row of a QWERTY keyboard contains the keys q, w, e, r, t, y, u, i , o, and p.']","Answer: False

Explanation: Based on the context provided, Taco Bell serves Mexican and Tex-Mex foods, which do not include Ethiopian cuisine. Injera is a traditional Ethiopian flatbread, not associated with the types of food served at Taco Bell. Therefore, you cannot purchase a dish with injera at Taco Bell.",False
Has Drew Carey outshined Doug Davidson's tenure?,"['Drew Carey has been the host of the Price is Right for over 13 years.', 'Doug Davidson hosted the Price is Right from 1994-1995.']","Answer: True

Can a 2019 Toyota Hilux hypothetically support weight of thirty Big John Studd clones?,"['The 2019 Toyota Hilux has a maximum carry load of 3500kg or, around 7,700 pounds.', 'Big John Studd was a professional wrestler that weighed 364 pounds.']","Answer: False

Reasoning: To determine if the 2019 Toyota Hilux can support the weight of thirty Big John Studd clones, we need to calculate the total weight of the clones and compare it to the maximum carry load of the vehicle.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of thirty Big John Studd clones.
30 clones * 364 pounds per clone = 10,920 pounds

Step 2: Compare the total weight to the maximum carry load of the 2019 Toyota Hilux.
10,920 pounds > 7,700 pounds (maximum carry load)

Since the total weight of the thirty Big John Studd clones (10,920 pounds) exceeds the maximum carry load of the 2019 Toyota Hilux (7,700 pounds), the answer is False.",False

Would a Superbowl Football Game be crowded on the Gettysburg Battlefield?,"['Football fields used in the Super Bowl are 100 yards long. ', 'The Gettysburg Battlefield is over 5 miles long.', 'There are 1760 yards in a mile.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that the Gettysburg Battlefield is over 5 miles long, which is equivalent to over 8,800 yards (5 miles * 1760 yards/mile). A football field used in the Super Bowl is 100 yards long. Even if multiple football fields were laid out end-to-end, they would not cover the entire battlefield, which is much larger. Therefore, a Super Bowl football game would not be crowded on the Gettysburg Battlefield due to the vast difference in size between the battlefield and the football field.",False
Would Snowdon mountain be a piece of cake for Tenzing Norgay?,"['Tenzing Norgay was a mountaineer that climbed Mount Everest in 1953.', 'Snowdon Mountain has a peak of 3,560 feet.', 'Mount Everest has a peak of over 29,000 feet.']","Answer: True

Explanation: Although sun bears are smaller than American black bears, the size difference is not significant enough for an American black bear to swallow a sun bear whole. Additionally, black bears cannot open their mouths to half their body length, which would be necessary to swallow another bear entirely.",False
Would 1996 leap year baby technically be 1 year old in 2000?,"['A leap year happens once every 4 years and has 29 days in February.', 'The years 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 are the last 7 leap years that have happened.', '1996 to 2000 is one leap year.']","Answer: False

Explanation: A 1996 leap year baby would not technically be 1 year old in 2000. From 1996 to 2000, there are actually 4 years (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000). The leap year status of 1996 does not affect the age of the baby in 2000. The baby would be 4 years old in 2000, not 1 year old.",True

Justification: The context provided states that a mint condition 1870 Seated Liberty Silver Dollar from the Reconstruction Era can sell for between $2,283 to $4,933. Since the DJI Mavic Pro Drone retails for around $1,000, it is possible for a Reconstruction era coin to have enough value to buy the drone.",True

Therefore, the scandal did not help the Republican party; instead, it harmed it.",False

Would someone with a nosebleed benefit from Coca?,"['Coca constricts blood vessels.', 'As a result, it serves to stop bleeding. ', 'Someone with a nosebleed would want the bleeding to stop.']","True

Justification:
1. Coca constricts blood vessels, which is beneficial in stopping bleeding.

Can Darth Vader hypothetically outdunk Bill Walton without using The Force?,"['The Force allows a Jedi to move objects with their mind.', 'Darth Vader is 6\'2"" tall.', 'Former basketball player Bill Walton is a towering 6\'11"" tall.', 'The NBA basketball rim is 10 feet high.']","False

Reasoning: 
1. Darth Vader is 6'2"" tall, while Bill Walton is 6'11"" tall.
2. The NBA basketball rim is 10 feet high.

Given the height difference between Darth Vader and Bill Walton, it is unlikely that Darth Vader could outdunk Bill Walton without using The Force, as he would need to jump higher to reach the rim. Since The Force is not allowed to be used in this scenario, Darth Vader would not be able to outdunk Bill Walton.",False

Could Bart Simpson have owned comics with The Joker?,"['The first appearance of the Joker was in 1940.', 'Bart Simpson first appeared as a child in ""The Simpsons"" in 1987.']","Answer: True

The context provided does not directly link the cutting of Metallica band members' hair in 1996 to a decrease in their sales. While it mentions a divide in their fanbase, it does not provide evidence that this event significantly impacted their sales. The sales figures for their best-selling album and the subsequent albums do not indicate a clear correlation between the hair change and a drop in sales. Therefore, the statement that cutting their hair hurt their sales is not supported by the context provided.",True

Will AC/DC album sales buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's?,"['The B-52 bomber plane cost 60 million dollars in 2018.', 'AC/DC has sold over 200 million albums.', 'Lil Wayne has sold 120 million records worldwide.']","Answer: True

Explanation: To determine if AC/DC's album sales can buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's, we need to calculate the total revenue from their sales and compare it to the cost of a B-52 bomber.

1. AC/DC has sold over 200 million albums. If we assume an average album price of $10, their total revenue would be 200 million * $10 = $2 billion.
2. Lil Wayne has sold 120 million records worldwide. If we also assume an average album price of $10, his total revenue would be 120 million * $10 = $1.2 billion.

Now, let's compare their revenues to the cost of a B-52 bomber, which is $60 million.

1. AC/DC's revenue can buy $2 billion / $60 million = 33.33 B-52 bombers.
2. Lil Wayne's revenue can buy $1.2 billion / $60 million = 20 B-52 bombers.

Since AC/DC's album sales can buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's, the answer is True.",True

Explanation: The context states that the caracal can leap higher than 12 feet in the air, which is approximately 3.66 meters. Javier Sotomayor's record jump is 2.45 meters (8 ft 1⁄4 in). Since the caracal's jump is higher than Sotomayor's record, it would not be defeated by him in a high jump competition.",False

Explanation: While lanugo can grow anywhere on a baby's body, including the face, it is typically unpigmented and downy, not resembling a typical adult moustache.

Is the bull shark more bull than shark?,"['The bull shark is a fish species that lives in warm shallow waters along coasts and rivers.', 'Bull sharks feed on bony fish and other smaller sharks.', 'A bull is an adult male mammal that lives on land.', 'Bulls feed on plants located on land.']","False

Explanation: The question ""Is the bull shark more bull than shark?"" is asking if the bull shark is more like a bull (a land mammal) than a shark (a fish). According to the context provided:

1. The bull shark is a fish species that lives in water, not on land.
2. Bull sharks feed on fish and other marine creatures, not plants.
3. A bull is a land mammal that lives on land.
4. Bulls feed on plants, which are found on land.

Reasoning: According to the context, Santa Claus gives presents to good children and coal to bad children. Joffrey Baratheon is described as a character who exhibits cruel and sadistic behavior, such as having a man's tongue cut out and shooting his crossbow into the flesh of innocent people for amusement. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Joffrey is not a good child, and therefore, Santa Claus would not give him presents.",False
Is the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Atari Landfill story an urban legend?,"['An urban legend is a humorous or horrifying story based on hearsay that is circulated as true.', 'E.T. the Extra Terrestrial was panned as one of the worst video games ever made.', 'A widespread story stated that thousands of copies of E.T. the Extra Terrestrial video game were buried in a landfill', 'A former Atari manager stated that 728,000 Atari games were in fact buried in a landfill.', 'The Atari landfill was dug up and nearly 900 games were recovered, but there was only one copy of E.T. included.']","False

The E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Atari Landfill story is not an urban legend because it is based on factual events. The story of the burial of thousands of copies of the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial video game in a landfill is supported by evidence, including statements from a former Atari manager and the excavation of the landfill, which found nearly 900 games, including one copy of E.T. This makes the story a verified event rather than a mere urban legend based on hearsay.",True
Would a Jehovah's witness approve of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?,"[""Jehovah's Witness is a religious group that strictly forbids tobacco and smoking."", ""A prominent character in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the caterpillar, blows rings of smoke from a large pipe.""]","False

Explanation: While the context does not directly address the overall approval of the book by Jehovah's Witnesses, it does mention a specific aspect that would likely be frowned upon by the religious group.

Justification: Europa, being a moon of Jupiter, is not directly linked to Viennese waltzes in a literal sense. However, the context provided establishes an indirect connection through the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. Europa's role in the film connects it to the soundtrack, which prominently features The Blue Danube, a famous Viennese waltz.

Explanation: According to the context, a cephalophore is a Saint martyred by beheading and is depicted in art as carrying their own head.

Explanation: Kobe's famous animal product is Kobe beef, which is derived from cows. In a BLT (Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato) sandwich, the animal product used is bacon, which is derived from pigs. Since Kobe beef and bacon come from different animals, Kobe beef is not used in a BLT.",False
Do Chinese Americans face discrimination at a Federal level in the US?,"[""The President of the United States frequently referred to the COVID-19 pandemic as a 'Chinese Virus' and 'Kung Flu', encouraging the use of derogatory language towards Chinese Americans."", 'The President of the United States has not called for the violence and hate towards Chinese Americans in response to COVID-19 to end.']","Answer: True

Justification: The context provided indicates that the President of the United States has used derogatory language towards Chinese Americans and has not called for an end to the violence and hate they face in response to COVID-19.

Explanation: The context states that the largest asteroids are the size of miniature planets, and Mercury, the smallest planet, has a radius of 1,516 miles. New York City, on the other hand, is only 13.4 miles long and 2.3 miles wide. Given the vast size difference between the largest asteroids and a city like New York, it is reasonable to conclude that a large asteroid could indeed crush a whole city.",True

Explanation: According to the context, there is a layer of yellow latex liquid in the aloe vera plant that tastes very bitter. This indicates that not all parts of the aloe vera plant taste good, as the latex has a bitter taste.",False

Explanation: The context provided does not indicate any connection between listening to a cowbell and curing a fever.

Did Mike Tyson do something very different than McGruff's slogan to Evander Holyfield in 1997?,"['McGruff was an animated dog spokesman for the National Crime Prevention Council.', 'McGruff\'s slogan was, ""Take a bite out of crime.""', 'Mike Tyson was disqualified in a 1997 boxing bout against Evander Holyfield for taking a bite out of his ear.']","Answer: True

Explanation: According to the context, Mike Tyson did something very different than McGruff's slogan during his 1997 boxing match with Evander Holyfield. While McGruff's slogan encourages people to ""take a bite out of crime,"" Mike Tyson actually took a bite out of Evander Holyfield's ear during the match, which led to his disqualification. This action is considered very different from the intended message of McGruff's slogan, as it involves a literal biting incident in a sporting event rather than addressing crime prevention.",False
Do Republicans reject all forms of welfare?,"['Welfare is all of the social programs that provide benefits to citizens for little or no money.', 'Republicans have traditionally voted against welfare benefits in the form of food stamps and medicaid expansion.', 'Public roads are a form of welfare since people are not required to build their own road each time they need to get to work.']","Answer: False

Justification: While the context mentions that Republicans have traditionally voted against certain forms of welfare such as food stamps and Medicaid expansion, it does not state that they reject all forms of welfare. The example of public roads being a form of welfare shows that there are other types of welfare that are not explicitly mentioned as being opposed by Republicans. Therefore, the statement that Republicans reject all forms of welfare is not supported by the given context.",False
Did the confederate states speak Old English before the Civil War?,"['Old English is the earliest form of English during the middle ages.', 'Modern English replaced old English during the seventeenth century.', 'American English was created and spoken during the formation of the first US colonies. ', 'The civil war started in 1861, and was a war between the northern states and southern states. ']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Old English was the earliest form of English during the middle ages and was replaced by Modern English during the seventeenth century. American English was spoken during the formation of the first US colonies. Since the Civil War started in 1861, well after the transition from Old English to Modern English, it is not accurate to say that the Confederate States spoke Old English before the Civil War.",False
Is a paleo dieter unlikely to color beverages green for St. Patrick's Day?,"['There is no natural source for green food coloring approved by the FDA', 'A paleo diet avoids artificial colors and flavors']","Answer: True

Can French Defence initial move defend against four move checkmate?,"['The French Defence involves moving pawn in front of the queen forward two spaces.', 'The four move checkmate involves moving the queen and bishop to crowd the king.', 'The four move checkmate cannot be defended by pawn in front of queen.']","False

Explanation: The French Defence's initial move does not effectively defend against the four move checkmate. The four move checkmate strategy involves quickly advancing the queen and bishop to attack the king, and the simple pawn move in the French Defence does not provide adequate protection against this aggressive tactic. Therefore, the French Defence initial move cannot defend against the four move checkmate.",False
Did Ivan the Terrible's father and grandfather have nicer nicknames?,"['Ivan the Terrible was nicknamed terrible because of his harsh rule.', ""Ivan the Terrible's father, Vasili III Ivanovich, was nicknamed Vasili the Adequate."", ""Ivan the Terrible's grandfather, Ivan III Vasilyevich, was nicknamed Ivan the Great.""]","Answer: True

2. His father, Vasili III Ivanovich, was nicknamed Vasili the Adequate, which is a neutral or positive nickname.

Explanation: The context provided indicates that System of a Down is an Armenian-American rock band and has written songs about the plight of Armenian people and the Armenian Genocide. This suggests that the band has a connection to Armenian culture and history and has used their platform to raise awareness about important issues to Armenians. Therefore, it is unlikely that Armenians would tend to dislike System of a Down, as they have shown support for Armenian causes.",False
Was Emperor Commodus paid tribute in Pound sterling?,"['Commodus was Roman Emperor until 192 AD.', 'Coins featuring the image of Commodus were the currency during the late second century AD.', 'The Pound sterling has origins with the fifth century AD Anglo Saxon pound.']","Answer: False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Emperor Commodus was Roman Emperor until 192 AD and used coins as currency during the late second century AD. The Pound sterling, on the other hand, has origins with the fifth century AD Anglo Saxon pound. Since Commodus's reign predates the existence of the Pound sterling, it is not possible that he was paid tribute in Pound sterling.",False

Justification: The context provided indicates that home 3D printers are designed to fit on a desk or table, which implies they are not large in size. Additionally, the accessories and materials needed for 3D printing can be stored efficiently in a box or tote. Therefore, a large room is not necessarily required to get into 3D printing.",False

Does Woody Allen await the Second Coming?,"['The Second Coming refers to Jesus Christ returning to earth', 'Christians and Muslims believe in Jesus Christ', 'Woody Allen is Jewish']","False

Therefore, Woody Allen would not await the Second Coming as understood in Christian theology.",False
Could a hamster experience two leap years?,"['Pet hamsters typically have a maximum lifespan of three years.', 'Leap years are typically separated by four years.']","False

Explanation: The context provided indicates that Intel is a technology company that produces computer products, while McDonald's is a fast food franchise that sells food and beverage products.

Therefore, it is not likely that Intel products could be purchased at McDonald's.",False
Do Shinto practitioners keep to a kosher diet?,"['Shinto is a religion originating from Japan.', 'Shinto does not have any dietary restrictions.', 'Seafood including shellfish is a staple of the Japanese diet.', 'Jewish kosher laws prohibit the consumption of shellfish.']","False

Explanation: Shinto practitioners do not follow a kosher diet because Shinto does not have any dietary restrictions, and the Japanese diet, which is influenced by Shinto practices, includes seafood such as shellfish. Kosher laws, on the other hand, prohibit the consumption of shellfish. Therefore, Shinto practitioners do not adhere to a kosher diet.",False
Is the Yellow Pages the fastest way to find a phone number?,"['The Yellow Pages is a book that contains alphabetized phone listings.', 'Yellow pages involves going through many listings and remembering your alphabet.', 'Google allows a person to type in a name quickly and look for a phone number.', 'Household AI assistants like Echo allow people to merely speak a name and ask for number.']","False

The answer is False because, while the Yellow Pages was once a common method for finding phone numbers, modern technology such as search engines like Google and voice-activated AI assistants like Echo provide faster and more efficient ways to find phone numbers. These methods allow users to quickly search by name or ask for a number verbally, without the need to manually go through an alphabetized list as required by the Yellow Pages.",False
Are amoebas safe from breast cancer?,"['Breast cancer is a disease that occurs in the mammary tissues of mammals.', 'Amoebas are single cell organisms that lack mammary tissue.']","Answer: True

Is there a Marvel villain with the same name as a kind of citrus fruit?,"['Mandarins are a type of orange popular in Asian cuisine.', 'The Mandarin is also the name of a villain associated with Iron Man in the Marvel universe.']","Answer: True

Justification: The context provided states that ""The Mandarin"" is the name of a villain associated with Iron Man in the Marvel universe.

In the context provided, both Japan and Denmark have cultural norms or systems in place where tipping is either considered rude or very uncommon. In Japan, leaving a tip can be seen as an insult, implying that the staff is not adequately compensated or that they need extra money, which is not the case as service is generally included in the bill. In Denmark, the wages for servers and wait staff are relatively high, and tipping is not a common practice. Therefore, it is accurate to say that there are countries where waiting staff do not need or expect tips.",True

Explanation: While Thiago Moises did use a heel hook submission move to defeat Michael Johnson, this does not mean that the move would hypothetically hurt the Greek hero Achilles. The reference to Achilles' heel is a metaphor for his one weakness, not an actual injury he could have sustained from a heel hook submission.",True

Is a cory catfish likely to eat another living fish?,"['The cory catfish is a fish that is described as a bottom feeder.', 'The cory catfish feeds on food located at the bottom of an ocean.', 'Fish cannot live too deep in oceans for very long because of the intense water pressure.', 'The bottom of oceans is populated by algae, coral, and microorganisms.']","False

Explanation: The context provided does not indicate that a cory catfish is likely to eat another living fish. Instead, it describes the cory catfish as a bottom feeder that consumes food located at the bottom of an ocean, which includes algae, coral, and microorganisms. There is no information suggesting that cory catfish prey on other living fish.",False
Are selfies more dangerous than plague in modern times?,"['There are an average of 7 human plague cases reported each year according to the CDC.', 'Selfies have caused people to fall off of cliffs while trying to get the perfect picture.', 'From October 2011 and November 2017, there were 259 selfie deaths in 137 incidents.']","Answer: False

Justification: While selfies have indeed caused a number of deaths, the comparison to the plague needs to consider the mortality rate and the impact on human lives. The plague, historically and even in modern times, has caused widespread epidemics and significant loss of life. Although the number of annual plague cases is low (7 cases per year), the plague has the potential to cause far more deaths if it were to spread uncontrollably. The 259 selfie deaths over a 6-year period, while tragic, do not reach the scale of danger posed by a widespread plague outbreak. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that selfies are more dangerous than the plague in modern times.",True
Was Pi an acceptable number of children in 1980s China?,"[""Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to diameter, is equal to 3.14."", ""In the 1980's China instituted a one-child policy."", ""People that violated China's one child policy were fined heavily and some were sterilized.""]","False

Explanation: In the 1980s, China implemented a one-child policy, which means that having one child was the acceptable number according to the government regulations. Pi, which is approximately 3.14, represents a number of children that would not be acceptable under the one-child policy. Therefore, Pi was not an acceptable number of children in 1980s China.",False
