The context states that a pound sterling is fiat money, which means it has no intrinsic value.

Here's the explanation:

Since students graduating high school in 2017 would have been born in 1999, they would have been only 2 years old when 9/11 occurred in 2001.

The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is a branch of the Catholic Church, and the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have been in a state of official schism since 1054.

They are large and powerful animals that can weigh up to 120 pounds, which is more than twice the weight of an average six-year-old child. Additionally, they have sharp canine teeth, which could be a safety risk for a child.

Here's the reasoning:

* Chlorine is toxic and can attack the respiratory system of humans (context 2), but...
* Chlorine is highly soluble in water and will dissolve in around 4 and a half days (context 3), which means that after a week, the chlorine would have dissolved and its toxic effects would be minimal.

According to the context, King James I wrote a book that described fairies as beings that could act as familiars, which were animals or spirits that conspired with The Devil.

Could Palm Beach be held in the palm of your hand?,"['Palm Beach has a total area of 8.12 square miles.', 'The average palm is around 3 inches in length.', 'There are 63360 inches in a mile.']","Let's calculate the answer.

Palm Beach has a total area of 8.12 square miles. Since there are 63360 inches in a mile, we can convert the area to square inches:

8.12 square miles × (63360 inches/mile)^2 = 8.12 × 63360 × 63360 = approximately 327,311,712 square inches

The average palm is around 3 inches in length, so the area of a palm is approximately:

3 inches × 3 inches = 9 square inches

Now, let's compare the area of Palm Beach to the area of a palm:

327,311,712 square inches (Palm Beach) ÷ 9 square inches (palm) ≈ 36,369

So, Palm Beach is approximately 36,369 times larger than the area of a palm. Therefore, the answer is:

Can eating your weight in celery prevent diabetes?,"['Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot process sugar.', 'Celery is known as a healthy snack and has 1 gram of sugar per serving.', 'The recommended daily intake of sugar to prevent diabetes is less than 36 grams per day for an adult male.', 'The average weight of an adult male is 197 pounds.']","Let's analyze the context:

1. Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot process sugar.
2. Celery is known as a healthy snack and has 1 gram of sugar per serving.
3. The recommended daily intake of sugar to prevent diabetes is less than 36 grams per day for an adult male.
4. The average weight of an adult male is 197 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the amount of sugar in celery if an adult male were to eat their weight in celery:

197 pounds ≈ 89,480 grams (approximate weight in grams)
If each serving of celery has 1 gram of sugar, the total sugar intake would be:
89,480 grams (celery) × 1 gram sugar/serving ≈ 89,480 grams of sugar

This is an enormous amount of sugar, far exceeding the recommended daily intake of less than 36 grams per day. Therefore, eating your weight in celery would actually increase the risk of diabetes, not prevent it.

Since Bernie Sanders is a senior citizen, he would pay $17 per visit. To visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art twenty times, he would need to pay 20 x $17 = $340. However, the question asks if he could visit twenty times for under two hundred dollars, which is not possible.",False
Could JPMorgan Chase give every American $10?,"['JPMorgan Chase has total assets of US$2.687 trillion.', 'As of November 8, 2018, the United States is estimated to have a population of 328,953,020.', 'One trillion is equal to 1,000 billions.', 'One billion is equal to 1,000 millions.']","Let's calculate if JPMorgan Chase could give every American $10:

JPMorgan Chase has total assets of $2.687 trillion.
The US population is approximately 328,953,020.

To find out if JPMorgan Chase could give every American $10, we need to calculate the total amount of money needed:

328,953,020 people x $10/person = $3,289,530,200

Now, let's convert the total assets of JPMorgan Chase to billions:

$2.687 trillion = $2,687,000,000,000
= $2,687,000 billion (since 1 trillion = 1,000 billion)

Now, let's compare the total amount of money needed with the total assets of JPMorgan Chase:

$3,289,530,200 (total amount needed) < $2,687,000,000,000 (JPMorgan Chase's assets)

Since the total amount needed is less than JPMorgan Chase's assets, the answer is:

Are all Wednesdays in a year enough to read Bible 15 times?,"['There are 52 Wednesdays in a year.', 'There are 1,248 hours over all the Wednesdays in a year.', 'The Old Testament of the Bible takes an average of 52 hours to read.', 'The New Testament of the Bible takes an average of 18 hours to read.']","Let's break it down:

We need to calculate the total hours required to read the Bible 15 times.

The Old Testament takes 52 hours to read, and the New Testament takes 18 hours to read. So, the total time to read the Bible once is:
52 hours (OT) + 18 hours (NT) = 70 hours

To read the Bible 15 times, we need:
70 hours x 15 = 1050 hours

We have 1248 hours available on all Wednesdays in a year. Since 1050 hours is less than 1248 hours, we have enough time to read the Bible 15 times on Wednesdays in a year.

Here's the reasoning:

Achilles was a demigod with superhuman strength and agility, making him a formidable warrior. However, his weakness was his heel, which was vulnerable to attack. Legolas, on the other hand, is an expert archer with incredible speed and accuracy. Given Achilles's weakness, Legolas could potentially exploit it and target his heel with an arrow.

Moreover, Legolas has the advantage of having a powerful wizard like Gandalf as his companion, who could provide magical support and potentially weaken Achilles or disrupt his movements. Achilles's companions, while skilled warriors, do not possess magical abilities that could counter Gandalf's powers.

Therefore, in a hypothetical fight, it's possible that Legolas could use his archery skills and Gandalf's magical support to gain the upper hand against Achilles.",False

The Gunpowder plot was a failed attempt to kill King James I, who was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots. Since the plot failed, it did not eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline.

Here's the explanation:

While Rand Paul is an ophthalmologist, he is not certified by a recognized board in New York. According to the context, the National Board of Ophthalmology does not recognize ABO certification, and NY ophthalmologists must have approved application for licensure certifications. Since Rand Paul's certification is not recognized in New York, he cannot legally practice ophthalmology in New York, and therefore, a New Yorker cannot get their eyes checked by him legally.",False

Could an NBA game be completed within the span of the Six-Day War?,"['The Six-Day War took place between June 5th-June 10th, 1967.', 'There are 24 hours in a day.', 'An NBA game consists of four quarters that are 12 minutes long and a 15 minute long halftime.', 'There are 60 minutes in an hour.']","Let's calculate the total time required to complete an NBA game:

4 quarters x 12 minutes per quarter = 48 minutes
+ 15 minutes halftime = 63 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
63 minutes ≈ 1 hour 3 minutes

Now, let's check if this time fits within the span of the Six-Day War:

June 5th-June 10th, 1967 = 6 days
6 days x 24 hours per day = 144 hours

The total time required to complete an NBA game (1 hour 3 minutes) is significantly less than the total hours available during the Six-Day War (144 hours). Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: True

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed in the principles of Communism, which emphasizes the absence of private ownership of property.

1. A fortnight is 2 weeks.
2. Centurylink's max internet plan speed is 1,000MB per second.
3. 1000GB takes 2.5 hours to upload for every 1000MB speed.

To find out if Centurylink's max internet plan can upload 1000GB in a fortnight, let's calculate the total upload time:

1000GB / 1000MB = 1000 uploads (since 1GB = 1000MB)
Each upload takes 2.5 hours, so:
1000 uploads × 2.5 hours/upload = 2500 hours

There are 336 hours in a fortnight (2 weeks × 168 hours/week). Since 2500 hours > 336 hours, it would take more than a fortnight to upload 1000GB.

According to the context, Drow are around 5 feet in height, and hobbits (like Bilbo Baggins) are half the size of humans, which means they are around 2.5-3 feet in height. So, a Drow would not tower over a hobbit, but rather be slightly taller.",True

The context suggests that the East India Company was a dominant player in global trade in the past, accounting for half of the world's trade.

Therefore, it is likely that the East India Company would prefer its own dominant position in the past to China's modern trade.",False

The context suggests that Operation Barbarossa, which was a 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, is unrelated to The Crusades, which were a series of medieval military campaigns. The connection between the two is only through the name ""Barbarossa"", which was shared by Frederick Barbarossa, a Holy Roman Emperor who drowned while marching his army to The Crusades.

Assuming a 50:50 male-to-female ratio, the total weight would be:

(6,192.5 males x 195 pounds) + (6,192.5 females x 168 pounds) = 1,204,313 pounds + 1,036,500 pounds = 2,240,813 pounds

Since the maximum towing capacity of the Ford F-350 is 15,000 pounds, it is not possible for the Ford F-350 to tow the entire Yale University student body.

The context suggests that Iggy Pop, a punk rocker, would not travel with Justin Bieber, a pop singer, because punk culture clashes against mainstream topics and ideals, and pop music is a mainstream form of music constructed to appeal to the masses. This implies that Iggy Pop would not associate with someone who represents the opposite of what punk culture stands for.",False

The context suggests that quadragenarians (people in their 40s) may experience some decline in memory capacity as they age, but it does not imply that they have little memory capacity. In fact, the example of Ken Jennings, who won a Jeopardy! tournament at the age of 46, suggests that people in their 40s can still have excellent memory and cognitive abilities.",False

The context suggests that Reza Shah and Queen Elizabeth I come from different ethnic and geographical backgrounds, making it highly unlikely for them to be related. Queen Elizabeth I was from English parents, while Reza Shah was Mazanderani, an indigenous people of Iran, which is nearly 4,000 miles away from England.",False

The context does not provide any information that suggests it's possible to get killed walking to the Very Large Telescope.

The context states that there have been two Popes from Spain, including Pope Alexander VI and Pope Callixtus III. This means that Spain is not the least represented country in papal history. In fact, Poland is the least represented country, with only one Pope, Pope John Paul II, of Polish origin.",False
Did France win the French Revolution?,"['The French Revolution was a period of  social and political upheaval in France and its colonies.', 'War is an intense military conflict between two states.', 'The French Revolution involved only France as citizens overthrew the monarchy.']","According to the context, the answer is: True

The question ""Did France win the French Revolution?"" is a bit misleading, as the French Revolution was not a war between two states, but rather a period of social and political upheaval within France. In this sense, it's not about ""winning"" or ""losing"", but rather about the outcome of the revolution, which was the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a new government.

The question asks if rainbows devoid of color are made by mixing yin and yang colors.

Could all of the famous Apollo's hypothetically defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's?,"[""The famous D'artagnan was a musketeer based on a count that served Louis XIV"", ""There are at least three famous Apollo's: Apollo Creed, Apollo (Greek mythology), and Apollo Crews."", 'Apollo, the Greek god of the sun and healing, is immortal.']","True.

Here's the reasoning:

* Apollo, the Greek god, is immortal, which means he cannot be defeated.
* Apollo Creed was a boxer, and while he may not be invincible, he was a skilled fighter.
* Apollo Crews is a professional wrestler, which also suggests he has combat skills.

On the other hand, the famous D'Artagnan was a musketeer, which means he was a skilled swordsman, but still a mortal human. Given the immortal nature of one of the Apollo's, it's likely that all of the famous Apollo's could hypothetically defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's.",True

King Leonidas led a small army of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians against the massive Persian army of 150,000 soldiers. Mozart composed 600 works, which is not a measure of the size of an army. Even if we were to interpret it as an army of 600 soldiers, it would still be a relatively small force compared to the Persian army, and King Leonidas would not have succeeded with such a small army.",False

Can a cheetah generate enough force to topple Big Show?,"['Big Show is a professional wrestler that weighs 383 pounds.', 'Force is equal to mass times acceleration.', 'An adult Cheetah weighs around 160 pounds.', 'An adult Cheetah can run up to 58 MPH.']","Let's analyze the context:

We need to calculate the force a cheetah can generate and compare it to the weight of Big Show.

Force = mass × acceleration

We know the mass of the cheetah (160 pounds) and its top speed (58 MPH). To calculate the acceleration, we need to know the time it takes for the cheetah to reach its top speed. Unfortunately, this information is not provided. However, we can make an educated estimate.

Let's assume the cheetah can accelerate from 0 to 58 MPH in about 3 seconds (a rough estimate, as cheetahs are known for their rapid acceleration). We can calculate the acceleration:

Acceleration = Δv / Δt = (58 MPH - 0) / 3 s ≈ 19.33 m/s² ( converted to meters per second squared)

Now, let's calculate the force:

Force = mass × acceleration = 160 pounds × 19.33 m/s² ≈ 3095 N (or approximately 697 lbf)

Big Show weighs 383 pounds, which is equivalent to about 1700 N (or approximately 383 lbf).

Comparing the forces, we can see that the cheetah's force (697 lbf) is not enough to topple Big Show's weight (383 lbf). Therefore, the answer is:

The context suggests that Hodor is not capable of complex thought or communication, as he can only utter his own name and is described as ""dimwitted"". Mathematicians, on the other hand, require advanced cognitive abilities and the ability to read and write to publish articles on theories. Therefore, it is unlikely that Hodor would be a good mathematician.",False

The question is asking if a Chinchilla breed of felis catus (a type of cat) is a type of rodent. According to the context, felis catus is the scientific name for a cat, and the Chinchilla breed of cats is a variant of the Persian breed of cats. This means that the Chinchilla breed of felis catus is a type of cat, not a rodent.",False

Does Hammurabi's Code violate Christians Golden Rule?,"['The Golden Rule of Christianity states to do unto others as you would want them to do to you.', ""Hammurabi's Code states an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.""]","True.

Explanation: Hammurabi's Code, which states ""an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"", implies a principle of retaliation and revenge, whereas the Golden Rule of Christianity emphasizes treating others with kindness and respect, as you would want them to treat you. These two principles are in conflict, so Hammurabi's Code can be seen as violating the Golden Rule.",True

Here's the explanation:

An aerodynamic cactus would have a smooth surface, which would reduce air flow around the plant. However, cactuses already have a mechanism to reduce air flow around them, which is their spines. The benefit of having more frequently closed stomata would be to prevent water loss, which is achieved through Crassulacean acid metabolism. This is already a characteristic of cactuses, so an aerodynamic cactus would not particularly benefit from more frequently closed stomata.",True

The context explains that cell biology deals with the structure and function of cells in living organisms, whereas Al Qaeda is a terrorist organization composed of terrorist cells, which are small groups of terrorists acting semi-independently. The term ""cell"" has a different meaning in this context, and cell biology does not teach about the life cycle of Al Qaeda.",False

The Snowy owl is adapted to the cold Arctic regions, and its temperature range is from -36.4F to 50F. The Sonoran Desert, on the other hand, can get as hot as 118F, which is far beyond the owl's tolerance. Therefore, it is unlikely that a Snowy owl could survive in the Sonoran Desert.",False

Here's the calculation:

Total US D-Day troops = 23,250 + 34,250 + 15,500 = 73,000

Here's the explanation:

Stone Cold Steve Austin made his wrestling debut on September 30, 1989, which falls in the 20th century. He retired on March 30, 2003, which falls in the 21st century. Therefore, he wrestled in two different centuries. However, since a century is a period of 100 years, the 20th century ended on December 31, 2000, and the 21st century began on January 1, 2001. This means that Austin also wrestled in the year 2000, which is still part of the 20th century. Therefore, he did not wrestle in three different centuries.",False

Here's the explanation:

Since the 24th US Census took place in 2020, the 25th US Census will take place in 2030. An anchovy born in 2020 has an average lifespan of 5 years, which means it will not survive until 2030. Therefore, the answer is False.",False

On the other hand, Kublai Khan's children were fierce warlords, which suggests they may have had an advantage in a physical competition like tug of war.

There are 525,600 minutes in a year, so:

129,000,000 minutes ÷ 525,600 minutes per year ≈ 245 years

The context states that Edward II was born in 1284 and his first campaign with his father against Scotland happened in 1300, which is after the Battle of Falkirk took place in 1298. Therefore, Edward II was not present at the Battle of Falkirk and did not contribute to England's victory.",False

The reasoning is that Paul Bunyan, being a giant, would be over 7 feet tall, and urban planners need to design buildings and ceilings that can accommodate people of average height. Since Paul Bunyan is much taller than average, he would not be able to fit in most urban buildings, making him a poor choice for an urban planner.",True

Could a markhor give birth three times in a single year?,"['The gestation period of a markhor lasts 135–170 days.', 'There are 365 days in a year.']","True.

Here's the calculation:

The gestation period of a markhor is 135-170 days. Let's take the minimum gestation period, which is 135 days.

There are 365 days in a year. To find out how many times a markhor can give birth in a year, we can divide 365 by 135:

365 ÷ 135 ≈ 2.7

Since you can't have a fraction of a birth, we can round down to 2. However, if we consider the maximum gestation period of 170 days, we can still fit in three births in a year:

365 ÷ 170 ≈ 2.15

Adding some extra time for recovery and mating, it's possible for a markhor to give birth three times in a single year.",False
Could  jockey win Triple Crown between Eid al-Fitr endpoints?,"['The Triple Crown is an accomplishment in which a jockey wins three specific races.', 'The three Triple Crown races are: Preakness, Kentucky Derby, and Belmont Stakes.', 'The three Triple Crown races take place weeks apart.', 'Eid al-Fitr is a Muslim holiday that lasts for three consecutive days.']","Based on the context, the answer is:

True

Here's the reasoning:

The context suggests that a greenhouse is an environment where plants are grown, and it also contains insects like aphids, fungus gnats, and caterpillars.

Is it dark is Basel during the day in Los Angeles?,"['Basel is located in the CEST time zone.', 'Los Angeles is located in the PDT time zone.']","False

Explanation: The question is asking if it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles. Since Basel is in the CEST time zone and Los Angeles is in the PDT time zone, they have a 9-hour time difference. When it's daytime in Los Angeles, it would be nighttime in Basel, so it would be dark in Basel.

The context suggests that the human stomach can break down glucose, which is a component of the bee's exoskeleton. However, it would take around 33 hours to break down glucose, which implies that the stomach acids can eventually break down the bee's exoskeleton, but it wouldn't be immediately destroyed.",True

The context provides information about the size of a football field and the Gettysburg Battlefield. A football field is 100 yards long, and there are 1760 yards in a mile. The Gettysburg Battlefield is over 5 miles long, which means it is much larger than a football field.

The context suggests that Metallica's best-selling album was released in 1991, before they cut their hair in 1996. The sales of their albums since 1996 (14 million copies) are still significant, but not necessarily hurt by the haircut.

Here's the calculation:

AC/DC has sold over 200 million albums. Assuming an average album price of $10 (a rough estimate), their total album sales revenue would be:

200,000,000 albums x $10/album = $2,000,000,000

Lil Wayne has sold 120 million records worldwide. Assuming an average record price of $10 (a rough estimate), his total record sales revenue would be:

120,000,000 records x $10/record = $1,200,000,000

With AC/DC's revenue, you could buy:

$2,000,000,000 ÷ $60,000,000 (cost of a B-52 bomber) = 33.33 B-52 bombers

With Lil Wayne's revenue, you could buy:

$1,200,000,000 ÷ $60,000,000 (cost of a B-52 bomber) = 20 B-52 bombers

Since 33.33 is greater than 20, AC/DC's album sales could buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's.",True
