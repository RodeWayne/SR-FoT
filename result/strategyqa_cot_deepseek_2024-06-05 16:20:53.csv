Next, note that only law enforcement officers are legally authorized to perform lawful arrests. Since The Police were not law enforcement officers, they would not have the legal authority to perform arrests. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is shrimp scampi definitely free of plastic?,"['Shrimp scampi is a dish made with shrimp.', 'Shrimp have been found to contain microplastics.', 'Microplastics are plastic material.']","First, consider the ingredients of shrimp scampi: it is a dish made with shrimp. Next, note that shrimp have been found to contain microplastics, which are small pieces of plastic material. Since shrimp can contain microplastics, and shrimp are a primary ingredient in shrimp scampi, it is not definite that shrimp scampi is free of plastic. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do the anchors on Rede Globo speak Chinese?,"['Rede Globo is a Brazilian television network.', 'The official language of Brazil is Portuguese.']","First, consider the context of Rede Globo: it is a Brazilian television network. Next, note the official language of Brazil: Portuguese. Given that the network is based in Brazil and the official language is Portuguese, it is highly unlikely that the anchors on Rede Globo speak Chinese as their primary language. They would most likely speak Portuguese and possibly other languages, but Chinese is not a common language in Brazil. The answer is 'False'.",False
Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?,"['Julius Caesar had three children.', 'Genghis Khan had sixteen children.', 'Modern geneticists have determined that  out of every 200 men today has DNA that can be traced to Genghis Khan.']","First, consider the number of offspring each historical figure had: Julius Caesar had three children, while Genghis Khan had sixteen. This indicates a larger potential for descendants from Genghis Khan. Additionally, modern geneticists have determined that approximately 1 in 200 men today carry DNA traceable to Genghis Khan, which suggests a significant number of descendants. Therefore, more people today are likely related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar due to his larger number of offspring and the spread of his genetic legacy over time. The answer is 'True'.",True
Will the Albany in Georgia reach a hundred thousand occupants before the one in New York?,"['Albany, GA has around 75,000 people', 'Albany, NY has almost 100,000 people']","First, consider the current population of each Albany: Albany, GA has around 75,000 people, while Albany, NY has almost 100,000 people. The question asks if Albany, GA will reach 100,000 occupants before Albany, NY. Since Albany, NY already has almost 100,000 people, it is already close to reaching the 100,000 mark, and Albany, GA has a significantly smaller population. Therefore, it is unlikely that Albany, GA will reach 100,000 occupants before Albany, NY. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?,"['Depression is caused by low levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.', 'Monoamine Oxidase breaks down neurotransmitters and lowers levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.']","First, consider the causes of depression: low levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Next, understand the function of Monoamine Oxidase (MAO): it breaks down neurotransmitters and lowers levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. A candy bar named ""Monoamine Oxidase"" would not be expected to contain actual MAO, but the name suggests it might have a negative impact on neurotransmitter levels if it did. Therefore, a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would not likely cheer up a depressed friend, as it could potentially worsen the neurotransmitter imbalance associated with depression. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is a pound sterling valuable?,"['A pound sterling is fiat money.', 'Fiat money is backed by government decree and has no intrinsic value.', 'One pound sterling is worth about 1.24 US dollars by May of 2020.']","First, consider the nature of a pound sterling: it is fiat money, which means it is backed by government decree and does not have intrinsic value. However, fiat money derives its value from the public's confidence in the issuing government and its ability to maintain the value of the currency. Next, consider the exchange rate of the pound sterling: as of May 2020, one pound sterling is worth about 1.24 US dollars. This exchange rate indicates that the pound sterling has purchasing power in international markets. Therefore, while the pound sterling does not have intrinsic value, it is considered valuable due to its recognized purchasing power and the stability of the British economy. The answer is 'True'.",False
Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?,"['Grey seals have no ear flaps and their ears canals are filled with wax.', 'Grey seals hear better underwater when their ears open like a valve.', 'Dogs have sensitive ears that can hear as far as a quarter of a mile away.']","First, consider the auditory capabilities of both animals: Grey seals have no ear flaps and their ear canals are filled with wax, which suggests they may not be as responsive to airborne sounds as dogs. Grey seals are better adapted to hear underwater, where their ears function more effectively. In contrast, dogs have sensitive ears that can hear as far as a quarter of a mile away, indicating a strong ability to detect and respond to airborne sounds. Given these differences in auditory sensitivity and the environments in which each animal typically operates, it is likely that a dog would respond to a bell before a Grey seal, as the dog is more attuned to the type of sound a bell produces in its natural environment. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is the language used in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines rooted in English?,"['The primary language spoken in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is Vincentian Creole.', 'Vincentian Creole is English-based, with elements of French, Antillean Creole, and indigenous South American and African languages.']","First, consider the primary language spoken in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which is Vincentian Creole. Next, note that Vincentian Creole is English-based, meaning it has its roots in English but also incorporates elements from French, Antillean Creole, and indigenous South American and African languages. Since the foundation of the language is English, the answer is 'True'.",True
Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?,"['The average cost of a US Boeing 737 plane is 1.6 million dollars.', 'Wonder Woman (2017 film) grossed over 800 million dollars at the box office.']","First, consider the cost of a Boeing 737 plane: the average cost is 1.6 million dollars. Next, consider the box office receipts of the Wonder Woman (2017 film): it grossed over 800 million dollars. Since the box office earnings of Wonder Woman are significantly higher than the cost of a Boeing 737, it is clear that the film's earnings could cover the cost of the plane. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can you buy Casio products at Petco?,"['Casio is a manufacturer of consumer electronics and watches', 'Petco is a chain store that sells pet supplies like food, bowls, litter, toys, cages and grooming equipment']","First, consider the products each company offers: Casio manufactures consumer electronics and watches, while Petco sells pet supplies such as food, bowls, litter, toys, cages, and grooming equipment. Since Petco's product range is focused on pet-related items and does not typically include consumer electronics or watches, it is unlikely that you can buy Casio products at Petco. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did the Space Race use relay batons?,"['The Space Race was a competition between the USA and USSR regarding spaceflight and exploration', 'Relay batons are used in relay races', 'Relay races are athletic track and field events']","First, consider the nature of the Space Race: it was a competition between the USA and USSR focused on spaceflight and exploration. Next, understand the purpose of relay batons: they are used in relay races, which are athletic track and field events. Since the Space Race involved space technology and exploration, not athletic competitions, it did not use relay batons. The answer is 'False'.",False
Are Christmas trees dissimilar to deciduous trees?,"['Christmas trees are usually pine trees.', 'Pine trees keep their needles all year round.']","First, consider the characteristics of Christmas trees and deciduous trees: Christmas trees are typically pine trees, which are evergreen and keep their needles all year round. Deciduous trees, on the other hand, lose their leaves in the fall and remain leafless during the winter. Since pine trees (commonly used as Christmas trees) retain their needles and do not undergo the leaf-shedding process that deciduous trees do, they are indeed dissimilar in this aspect. The answer is 'True'.",True
Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?,"['The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy.', 'Monarchies do not allow citizens to elect their own rulers.']","First, consider the context provided: The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy, and monarchies do not typically allow citizens to elect their own rulers. In a monarchy, the ruler is usually determined by hereditary succession or by appointment, not by popular vote. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unlikely that landowners in the Kingdom of Hungary elected their rulers. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does Biochemistry study gluons?,"['Biochemistry studies role, function, and structure of biomolecules.', 'Gluon, the so-called messenger particle of the strong nuclear force, which binds sub-atomic particles known as quarks within the protons and neutrons of stable matter as well as within heavier, short-lived particles created at high energies.', 'biomolecules are comprised of atoms. ']","First, consider the focus of biochemistry: it studies the role, function, and structure of biomolecules. These biomolecules are comprised of atoms. Next, examine what gluons are: they are particles that mediate the strong nuclear force, binding subatomic particles like quarks within protons, neutrons, and other particles. Gluons are fundamental to the structure of atomic nuclei but are not directly related to the biomolecules studied in biochemistry. Therefore, biochemistry does not study gluons as they are not directly involved in the biomolecular processes or structures that biochemistry investigates. The answer is 'False'.",False

']","First, consider the political context: abortion is a divisive issue between the Republican and Democratic parties. Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat, and her political stance aligns with the Democratic base, which is largely pro-choice on the issue of abortion. Given this alignment, it is unlikely that Nancy Pelosi would publicly denounce abortion, as it would contradict the views of her party's base and potentially harm her political standing within the Democratic Party. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday 13th number of projects?,"['Dragon Ball has 6 TV series, 3 TV specials, and 2 direct to video spinoffs as of 2020.', 'Friday the 13th has 12 movies in the franchise and 1 TV series as of 2020.']","First, consider the number of projects in each franchise: Dragon Ball has 6 TV series, 3 TV specials, and 2 direct-to-video spinoffs, totaling 11 projects. Friday the 13th has 12 movies and 1 TV series, totaling 13 projects. Comparing the total number of projects, Friday the 13th has more projects than Dragon Ball. Therefore, the answer is 'True', Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday the 13th's number of projects.",True
Would a student of the class of 2017 have amnesia about 9/11?,"['Childhood amnesia is common, with most adults not remembering their lives before 2 or 3 years of age', '9/11 occurred in 2001', 'Students graduating high-school in 2017 would have been born in 1999']","First, consider the concept of childhood amnesia: most adults do not remember their lives before the age of 2 or 3. Next, consider the date of the 9/11 attacks: they occurred in 2001. Then, consider the birth year of students graduating in 2017: they would have been born in 1999. Since these students would have been at least 2 years old at the time of 9/11, they would not be affected by childhood amnesia regarding this event. Therefore, a student of the class of 2017 would not have amnesia about 9/11. The answer is 'False'.",True
Would a psychic who admits to hot reading be trustworthy?,"['Hot reading is a technique used by people presenting themselves as psychics to acquire information about a subject prior to the psychic session.', 'Hot reading is considered deception in the psychic community.']","First, consider the definition and implications of hot reading: it is a technique used by people claiming to be psychics to gather information about a subject before the psychic session, which is considered deception within the psychic community. If a psychic admits to using hot reading, this indicates that they have been using deceptive practices to present their psychic abilities. Trustworthiness is based on honesty and integrity. Since hot reading is a deceptive practice, a psychic who admits to using it would not be considered trustworthy. The answer is 'False'.",False
"If you were on a diet, would you have to skip lunch at McDonald's?","[""McDonald's offers low calorie brunch options like parfaits and egg white sandwiches. "", ""McDonald's offers low calorie lunch options including basic hamburgers and salads.""]","First, consider the context provided about McDonald's offerings: they provide low calorie brunch options like parfaits and egg white sandwiches, as well as low calorie lunch options such as basic hamburgers and salads. If you are on a diet, it does not necessarily mean you have to skip lunch at McDonald's. You can choose from their low calorie options to adhere to your diet while still enjoying a meal there.

Therefore, someone with fine motor control issues could indeed benefit from an altered keyboard layout tailored to their specific needs. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?,"['Greed is a longing for wealth and power.', 'White collar crime involves businesses stealing money or assets from people. ', '5-10% of arrests per 100,000 arrests were for  white collar crime according to Department of Justice statistics.', 'Gluttony is the overindulgence in food or similar things.', '39.8% of US adults were classified as overweight according to the National Center for Health Statistics.']","First, consider the context provided for each of the Seven Deadly Sins. For greed, the context mentions that it is a longing for wealth and power, and it is associated with white-collar crime, which accounts for 5-10% of arrests per 100,000 arrests according to Department of Justice statistics. For gluttony, the context states that it is the overindulgence in food or similar things, and it is associated with 39.8% of US adults being classified as overweight according to the National Center for Health Statistics.

To determine which sin is the most prevalent, we need to compare the prevalence of each sin based on the provided statistics. The statistic for greed is based on arrests, which may not fully represent the prevalence of greed in society, as not all instances of greed may lead to arrests. The statistic for gluttony, on the other hand, is based on a direct measure of overweight adults, which is a clear indicator of overindulgence in food.

Given that the statistic for gluttony (39.8% of US adults being overweight) is significantly higher than the statistic for greed (5-10% of arrests for white-collar crime), it suggests that gluttony may be more prevalent than greed. However, this comparison only includes two of the Seven Deadly Sins, and to definitively answer whether greed is the most prevalent, we would need to consider the prevalence of the other sins as well.

Without additional context or statistics for the other sins, we cannot conclusively determine that greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined based on the provided context alone.",False

Is the tibia necessary to win the Stanley Cup?,"['The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy of the National Hockey League', 'Ice hockey is a game played by individuals wearing ice skates to move around a frozen playing field', 'The tibia is a leg bone', 'Legs are required in order to use ice skates']","First, consider the context of the Stanley Cup: it is the championship trophy of the National Hockey League, and ice hockey is played on ice with players wearing ice skates. Next, understand the role of the tibia: it is a leg bone, and legs are required to use ice skates effectively. Since ice skates are necessary for playing ice hockey, and the tibia is a critical component of the leg, it can be inferred that the tibia is necessary for an individual to participate in ice hockey and potentially contribute to a team's success in winning the Stanley Cup. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would a broadcast from Spirit make the news in 2020?,"['In 2010, the Spirit rover sent what is recorded as its final transmission.', 'In 2019, another rover made the news with its viral ""final words""']","First, consider the timeline of events related to the Spirit rover: In 2010, the Spirit rover sent its final transmission, and by 2020, it had been inactive for a decade. Next, note that in 2019, another rover made the news with its viral ""final words,"" indicating that space missions can generate significant media attention. However, since the Spirit rover had ceased operations in 2010 and no new transmissions were expected, a broadcast from Spirit in 2020 would be highly unusual and unexpected. Such an event would likely make the news due to its unexpected nature and the historical significance of the Spirit rover. The answer is 'True'.",True
"If your skin was turning the color of a zombie, could it be because of nickel?","['Zombies are often depicted as green in pallor.

Next, examine the characteristics of a Dolce & Gabbana suit, specifically the Two Tone Dolce & Gabbana suit, which has several buttons. Since the suit violates the Amish dress code, it is likely that an Amish person would view the wearer as not adhering to their cultural norms. Additionally, the Amish practice shunning as a form of discipline for those who do not follow their rules. Therefore, it is plausible that a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer would be shunned by their Amish cousins due to the contrast in clothing styles and the Amish practice of shunning those who do not conform to their beliefs. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would an ethics professor teach a class on Cezanne?,"['Cezanne was an Impressionist painter', 'Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the arts']","First, consider the subjects of ethics and aesthetics: ethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with moral principles and conduct, while aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty, art, and taste. Cezanne, being an Impressionist painter, falls under the realm of art, which is primarily associated with aesthetics. An ethics professor, whose expertise is in moral philosophy, may not typically teach a class specifically on Cezanne, as that would be more aligned with the subject matter of aesthetics. However, it is possible that an ethics professor could include discussions on art or even Cezanne in a broader context, such as exploring the ethical implications of art or the role of aesthetics in society. Nonetheless, a class specifically on Cezanne would more likely be taught by an art history professor or an aesthetics specialist. The answer is 'False'.",False

Can a strawberry get worms similar to dogs?,"['Strawberry can suffer from black root rot and nematodes.', 'Dogs can suffer from a variety of worms including roundworms that lay eggs on them.', 'Nematodes are parasites that are also called roundworms and ascarids.', 'Nematodes are parasites that feed off of strawberry plants.']","First, consider the types of parasites that affect strawberries and dogs: strawberries can suffer from black root rot and nematodes, while dogs can suffer from a variety of worms including roundworms. Nematodes, which affect strawberries, are also referred to as roundworms and ascarids. These nematodes are parasites that feed off of strawberry plants. Although the term ""worm"" is used in both cases, the context and impact of these parasites are different. Nematodes in strawberries are not the same as the worms that infest dogs, as they do not lay eggs on the plants or cause the same type of infestation. Therefore, while both strawberries and dogs can be affected by parasites referred to as ""worms,"" the nature of these parasites and their effects are not the same. The answer is 'False'.",True
"While on a liquid diet, are there some types of soup you cannot eat?","['Italian wedding soup has large chunks including meatballs and pasta which require chewing.', 'Chicken Noodle soup has chunks of chicken and large noodles in it that require chewing.']","First, consider the requirements of a liquid diet: it typically involves consuming only liquids that do not require chewing.

Would the Titanic be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland?,"[""The bottom of the gulf is one of the world's largest ship cemeteries. Because of the low salinity and cold waters, and no shipworms, the ships are relatively well preserved."", 'RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship.']","First, consider the conditions at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland: it is characterized by low salinity, cold waters, and the absence of shipworms, which contribute to the relatively well-preserved state of ships found there. Next, consider the RMS Titanic, a British passenger ship that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean. The preservation of the Titanic would depend on similar conditions.

However, the Titanic is not located at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland; it rests at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, which has different environmental conditions, including higher salinity and different temperatures. Therefore, the preservation of the Titanic cannot be directly compared to that of ships in the Gulf of Finland.

The answer to whether the Titanic would be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland is 'False' because the Titanic is not located there, and the conditions are not directly comparable.",True
Would a Pict be confused by Old English?,"['Old English was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, a Germanic tribe that inhabited England.', 'The Picts were a Celtic-speaking people that lived in what is now Scotland.', 'The Pictish language died out by 1100AD and was replaced by Gaelic.', 'Gaelic and Old English are completely different languages from different branches of the Indo-European language family.', 'Gaelic vocabulary is very different from Old English  and verbs are also conjugated differently.']","First, consider the linguistic backgrounds of the Picts and the Anglo-Saxons: the Picts spoke a Celtic language, while Old English was a Germanic language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons. The Pictish language had died out by 1100AD and was replaced by Gaelic, which is also a Celtic language. Old English and Gaelic are from different branches of the Indo-European language family and have distinct vocabularies and grammatical structures. Given that the Picts spoke a Celtic language and Old English is a Germanic language with no known direct linguistic overlap, it is likely that a Pict would indeed be confused by Old English due to the significant differences between the two languages. The answer is 'True'.",True
Is the best tasting part of the papaya in the center?,"['The center of a papaya contains a cluster of seeds.', 'Papaya seeds, while edible, are often discarded for the soft flesh that surrounds them.']","First, consider the composition of a papaya: the center contains a cluster of seeds, and the surrounding area is filled with soft flesh. While papaya seeds are edible, they are often discarded in favor of the soft flesh, which is generally considered to be the best-tasting part of the fruit. Therefore, the best tasting part of the papaya is not in the center but in the soft flesh that surrounds the seeds. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, examine the roles of Tom Bergeron: he is the host of both Dancing With The Stars and America's Funniest Home Videos. Since Tom Bergeron holds two hosting positions simultaneously, the phrase ""double duty"" accurately describes his situation. The answer is 'False', as ""double duty"" is a correct phrase for the host of Dancing With The Stars in this context.",False
Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?,"['Serfs in Medieval England were peasants that were indentured servants to their lords.', 'Serfs were often harshly treated and had little legal redress against the actions of their lords.', 'Japanese serfs were farmers and fishermen.', 'Japanese believed that serfs produced food, which was depended on by all classes, therefore, they worked harder.']","First, consider the status of serfs in both Medieval England and Japan. In England, serfs were peasants who were essentially indentured servants to their lords, often treated harshly and with little legal protection. In Japan, serfs were primarily farmers and fishermen, and their role in producing food was considered essential by all classes. The context suggests that the Japanese society recognized the importance of serfs' work, which might imply a higher social status or at least a more acknowledged role in society compared to their English counterparts. However, it is important to note that both groups were still in a subservient position. The answer is 'True', but it is a nuanced comparison based on societal perception and acknowledgment of their role rather than absolute legal or social status.",True

Could an ocelot subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day?,"['An ocelot requires 600–800 grams (21–28 oz) of food every day to satisfy its energy requirements.', 'Bee hummingbirds are the smallest living birds, with an average weight of around 2-3 grams.']","First, consider the daily food requirements of an ocelot: it needs 600–800 grams (21–28 oz) of food to meet its energy needs. Next, consider the weight of a bee hummingbird, which is the smallest living bird, weighing around 2-3 grams. To determine if a single bee hummingbird could sustain an ocelot, compare the weight of the bird to the ocelot's daily food requirement. A single bee hummingbird weighs significantly less than the minimum daily requirement for an ocelot (2-3 grams vs. 600 grams). Therefore, an ocelot could not subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day as it would not provide enough food to meet the ocelot's energy needs. The answer is 'False'.",False

The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, on the other hand, is a branch of the Catholic Church. These two churches have been in a state of official schism since the East–West Schism of 1054, meaning they maintain separate and distinct doctrines, including their lists of saints.

Given that the Russian Orthodox Church canonized Alexander Nevsky and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church follows the Catholic Church's teachings and not the Eastern Orthodox Church's, it is unlikely that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church recognizes Alexander Nevsky as a saint. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does Andrew Johnson's presidential number exceed Elagabalus's Emperor number?,"['Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States.', 'Elagabalus was the 25th Roman Emperor.']","First, consider the respective positions of Andrew Johnson and Elagabalus in their respective leadership roles: Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States, and Elagabalus was the 25th Roman Emperor. To determine if Andrew Johnson's presidential number exceeds Elagabalus's Emperor number, compare the numbers: 17 (Johnson's presidential number) versus 25 (Elagabalus's Emperor number).

Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?,"['The average weight of a six year old is 45 pounds.', 'One gallon of seawater weighs slightly over 8 pounds.']","First, calculate the total weight of ten gallons of seawater: one gallon of seawater weighs slightly over 8 pounds, so ten gallons would weigh approximately 80 pounds (10 * 8 = 80). Next, consider the average weight of a six-year-old, which is 45 pounds. Comparing the weight of the seawater to the weight of the child, the seawater is significantly heavier. However, the question is whether this weight could crush the child. Crushing typically implies a force that is applied over a small area, causing extreme pressure. Simply pouring ten gallons of seawater on a six-year-old would not necessarily crush them, as the weight would be distributed over a larger area (the surface area of the child's body). The answer is 'False'.",True

However, there are significant differences in the rules and outcomes of the contests. In MMA, fights are stopped when one of the combatants is incapacitated, whereas in the Roman Colosseum games, fights continued until the last man was standing.

Next, consider the origins of MMA: It is a modern sport that combines techniques from various martial arts and combat sports, developed in the late 20th century. The Roman Colosseum games, on the other hand, were a form of entertainment in ancient Rome that involved gladiatorial combat and other forms of fighting.

Does frost mean that it will be a snowy day?,"['Frost forms regularly in areas that experience freezing temperatures and morning dew.', ""Frost isn't deposited from the sky like snow, it forms on the ground.""]","First, consider the nature of frost: it forms regularly in areas that experience freezing temperatures and morning dew, and it forms on the ground rather than falling from the sky like snow. Frost is a result of the ground and other surfaces cooling to below the freezing point of water, causing the moisture in the air to freeze on contact. This process is different from the formation of snow, which requires specific atmospheric conditions involving the presence of ice crystals in the clouds that fall to the ground.

Given that frost and snow are formed through different mechanisms and are not directly related, the presence of frost does not necessarily indicate that it will be a snowy day. Snowfall depends on the availability of moisture in the atmosphere and the temperature profile of the air, which allows for the formation and fall of snowflakes.

Therefore, the answer is 'False'. Frost does not mean that it will be a snowy day.",False

Can eating your weight in celery prevent diabetes?,"['Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot process sugar.', 'Celery is known as a healthy snack and has 1 gram of sugar per serving.', 'The recommended daily intake of sugar to prevent diabetes is less than 36 grams per day for an adult male.', 'The average weight of an adult male is 197 pounds.']","First, consider the context provided: Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot process sugar. Celery is a healthy snack with 1 gram of sugar per serving. The recommended daily intake of sugar to prevent diabetes is less than 36 grams per day for an adult male. The average weight of an adult male is 197 pounds.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar consumed if an adult male were to eat his weight in celery. Assuming the average adult male weighs 197 pounds, and if we consider that celery weighs approximately the same as water (1 pound = 16 oz, and 1 oz of water = 1 oz of celery), then eating 197 pounds of celery would mean consuming 197 pounds * (1 gram of sugar per pound of celery) = 197 grams of sugar.

Comparing this to the recommended daily intake of less than 36 grams of sugar to prevent diabetes, it is clear that eating one's weight in celery would not prevent diabetes, as it would result in a significantly higher sugar intake than recommended. Therefore, the answer is 'False'.",False

Burr continued his term as Vice President after the incident. However, this does not establish a precedent for killing with impunity. The duel was conducted under specific circumstances and within the context of the social norms and laws of the time, which included the understanding of a duel as a legal and honorable way to settle disputes.

Next, consider the legal context: US stand-your-ground laws allow a person to defend themselves even to the point of applying lethal force, but these laws have specific criteria and are not a blanket permission for anyone, including the Vice President, to kill without consequence. These laws typically require a threat to one's life or safety, and the use of force must be proportionate to the threat.

Therefore, the answer is 'False'. The Vice President of the United States, like any other citizen, is not immune from legal consequences for taking a life. The outcome of Aaron Burr's duel was specific to the circumstances of the time and does not imply that a Vice President can kill with impunity under current laws and norms.",True

Will the torso be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in body?,"['The three smallest bone in the body are malleus, incus, and stapes.', 'Malleus, incus, and stapes are located in the ear.', 'The femur is the largest bone in the body.', 'The femur is located in the leg.', 'The torso is located in the center of the body.']","First, identify the locations of the smallest and largest bones in the body: the smallest bones, malleus, incus, and stapes, are located in the ear, and the largest bone, the femur, is located in the leg. Next, consider the location of the torso, which is in the center of the body. Since the smallest bones are in the ear and the largest bone is in the leg, neither of these bones is located in the torso. Therefore, the torso will be safe from blows specifically targeting the largest and smallest bones in the body, as neither of these bones is within the torso's area. The answer is 'True'.",True
Did the Berlin Wall prevent any athletes from competing in the 1936 Summer Olympics?,"['The 1936 Olympics were held in 1936.', 'The Berlin Wall was not constructed until 1961.']","First, consider the timeline of the events: the 1936 Summer Olympics were held in 1936, and the Berlin Wall was constructed much later, in 1961. Since the Berlin Wall did not exist during the time of the 1936 Olympics, it could not have prevented any athletes from competing in those games. The answer is 'False'.",False

This suggests that Route 66 has a significant presence in American popular culture. Given its prominence in music and its historical role as a major U.S. highway, it is unlikely that Route 66 is generally unknown to Americans. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is Shiva's divine dance an ancient physical fitness pose?,"[""In yoga as exercise, the pose called Natarajasara represents Shiva's divine dance"", 'This pose is new, originating in the early 20th century', 'Exercise is an activity that maintains physical fitness']","First, consider the context provided: In yoga as exercise, the pose called Natarajasana represents Shiva's divine dance. This pose is new, originating in the early 20th century. Exercise is an activity that maintains physical fitness. Given that Natarajasana is a modern creation and represents Shiva's divine dance, it can be considered a physical fitness pose. However, it is not ancient, as it was developed in the early 20th century. Therefore, while Shiva's divine dance is represented by a physical fitness pose, the pose itself is not ancient.

Would Woodrow Wilson support Plessy v. Ferguson decision?,"['Plessy v Ferguson was a landmark case that stated segregation did not violate the constitution.', 'President Woodrow Wilson escalated the discriminatory hiring policies and segregation of government offices.', 'By the end of 1913, under President Wilson, many departments, including the navy, had segregated work spaces, restrooms, and cafeterias.']","First, consider the context of Plessy v. Ferguson: it was a landmark case that upheld the ""separate but equal"" doctrine, stating that segregation did not violate the Constitution. Next, examine President Woodrow Wilson's actions and policies: he escalated discriminatory hiring policies and supported the segregation of government offices. By the end of 1913, under his administration, many departments, including the navy, had segregated workspaces, restrooms, and cafeterias. Given Wilson's support for segregation and the alignment of his policies with the principles upheld in the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, it is likely that Woodrow Wilson would support the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. The answer is 'True'.",True
Are the Vietnamese people a great untapped resource for NBA players?,"['Vietnam was ranked as one of the countries with the shortest people on average, in 2019.', 'The average height of a Vietnamese man is 5 feet 4.74 inches.', 'The average height of an NBA player in 2018 was 6 foot 7 inches tall.']","First, consider the average height of Vietnamese people: in 2019, Vietnam was ranked as one of the countries with the shortest people on average, with the average height of a Vietnamese man being 5 feet 4.74 inches. Next, compare this to the average height of an NBA player in 2018, which was 6 feet 7 inches tall. The significant height difference between the average Vietnamese man and the average NBA player suggests that the Vietnamese population, on average, may not be a great untapped resource for NBA players due to their shorter stature.

Would a Bulgarian priest eat a four-course meal on Christmas Eve?,"['A four-course meal consists of a soup, an appetizer, an entrée, and dessert.', 'The Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal has an odd number of dishes and an odd number of people sitting around the table.']","First, consider the structure of a four-course meal: it consists of a soup, an appetizer, an entrée, and dessert. This typically results in an even number of dishes when counted as individual courses. Next, consider the tradition of the Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal: it includes an odd number of dishes and an odd number of people sitting around the table. This tradition is rooted in Bulgarian customs and beliefs, which emphasize the significance of odd numbers in their religious and cultural practices.

Given that a four-course meal results in an even number of dishes, it does not align with the traditional Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal, which requires an odd number of dishes. Therefore, it is unlikely that a Bulgarian priest would eat a four-course meal on Christmas Eve, as it would not conform to the traditional customs of the Bulgarian Christmas Eve meal. The answer is 'False'.",False
"Will every resident of Los Angeles County, California go to Jehovah Witnesses's heaven?","['Jehovah Witnesses believe that exactly 144,000 people will be saved and go to heaven.', 'There are over 10 million residents of Los Angeles County, California as of 2019.']","First, consider the beliefs of Jehovah Witnesses: they believe that exactly 144,000 people will be saved and go to heaven. Next, consider the population of Los Angeles County, California: there are over 10 million residents as of 2019. Since the number of people who will be saved according to Jehovah Witnesses' beliefs is significantly less than the total number of residents in Los Angeles County, it is not possible for every resident of Los Angeles County to go to Jehovah Witnesses' heaven.

', ""It would be considered animal abuse to ride on a kangaroo and leave it at one's job.""]","First, consider the behavior of kangaroos: they can become aggressive if they feel a human is too close or is threatening them, which makes them unsuitable as a mode of transportation. Next, consider practical aspects: there are no parking areas or stalls for kangaroos in Australia, indicating that kangaroos are not used as a common form of transport. Lastly, ethical considerations: it would be considered animal abuse to ride on a kangaroo and leave it at one's job, which is against societal norms and laws. Therefore, the answer is 'False'; Australians do not ride kangaroos to work.",False
Did origin dynasty of Go precede Jia Sidao?,"['Go is a strategy game that originated in the Zhou dynasty.', 'The Zhou dynasty lasted from 1046 BC – 256 BC.', 'Jia Sidao was a chancellor during the late Song dynasty.', 'The Song dynasty started in 960 AD and lasted until 1279 AD.']","First, consider the time periods of the Zhou dynasty and the Song dynasty. The Zhou dynasty lasted from 1046 BC to 256 BC, while the Song dynasty started in 960 AD and lasted until 1279 AD. Jia Sidao was a chancellor during the late Song dynasty.

Would Emma Roberts's Nancy Drew be considered a private investigator?,"['Emma Roberts starred as Nancy Drew in the 2007 film titled Nancy Drew.', 'A private investigator is hired by an individual to solve a crime.', 'Nancy Drew from the 2007 film was described as an amateur sleuth.', 'Nancy Drew in the 2007 film was interested in a case and decided to pursue it on her own, without being paid for it.']","First, consider the definition of a private investigator: someone who is hired by an individual to solve a crime. Next, examine the role of Nancy Drew in the 2007 film: she is described as an amateur sleuth who takes on a case out of personal interest rather than being hired to do so. Although Nancy Drew engages in investigative activities similar to those of a private investigator, she does not meet the criteria of being hired by someone to solve a crime. Therefore, Emma Roberts's Nancy Drew would not be considered a private investigator in the traditional sense. The answer is 'False'.",False

', 'Garfield loves to eat spaghetti.', 'Canid refers to the species that dogs belong to.', 'Dogs like to eat meat and dog food.']","First, consider the species of Garfield: he is a fictional cat character. Next, note that Garfield has a preference for eating spaghetti, which is not typical cat food. Canid food, on the other hand, refers to food specifically designed for dogs, a species different from cats. Cats and dogs have different dietary needs and preferences. Therefore, it is unlikely that Garfield would like canid food, as it is not tailored to the dietary needs or preferences of a cat. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, consider the identity and activism of Opal Tometi: she is an African American woman and a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, a movement advocating for the rights and safety of African Americans against racial violence and police brutality. Given that the Ku Klux Klan opposes the very groups and causes that Opal Tometi supports and represents, it is highly unlikely that they would welcome her into their group. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Jane Austen suffer from middle child syndrome?,"['Jane Austen was the second youngest of 8 children.', ""Middle child syndrome is the feeling of exclusion by middle children, due directly to their placement in their family's birth order.""]","First, consider Jane Austen's birth order in her family: she was the second youngest of 8 children. This means she was not a middle child, as middle children are typically those who are neither the oldest nor the youngest in a family. Since Jane Austen was not a middle child, she would not have experienced middle child syndrome, which is associated with the feelings of exclusion by middle children due to their placement in the family's birth order. The answer is 'False'.",False
Do hyenas appear in a Broadway musical?,"[""Scar is the evil lion in Disney's Lion King."", ""Scar's minions are a group of hyenas."", 'There is a Broadway stage version of Lion King.']","First, consider the context provided: Scar is the evil lion in Disney's Lion King, and his minions are a group of hyenas.

Can an emu chase a bogan?,"['Emus are endemic to the continent of Australia', 'Bogan is a pejorative term for certain citizens of Australia']","First, consider the context provided: Emus are native to Australia, and a bogan is a derogatory term for certain Australian citizens. The question ""Can an emu chase a bogan?"" is somewhat nonsensical as it mixes a biological entity (the emu) with a slang term for a person (bogan). Emus are large, flightless birds known for their speed and can potentially chase a person if they feel threatened or provoked. However, the term ""bogan"" does not specify a physical target for the emu to chase; it is a social label. Therefore, the question is not clearly answerable in a literal sense. If interpreted metaphorically, one could say that the cultural or social aspects of being a ""bogan"" are not something that can be chased by an emu. The answer is 'False', as the question is not logically coherent in its current form.",True
Would a pacifist be opposed to hunting?,"['Pacifists are a group opposed to violence and war.', 'Amish people are well known for their pacifism.', 'Amish people hunt for meat and sport.']","First, consider the definition of a pacifist: they are a group opposed to violence and war. Next, note that Amish people are well known for their pacifism and yet they hunt for meat and sport. This suggests that while pacifists generally oppose violence, the context and purpose of the violence (such as hunting for sustenance or sport) may be factors that influence their stance. Therefore, it is not universally true that all pacifists would be opposed to hunting, as the Amish example shows that some pacifists engage in hunting. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles a preposterous claim?,"['ABBA was a Swedish band that had 1 Billboard number 1 hit and 4 top 10 hits.', 'The Beatles had 20 Billboard number 1 hits and 34 top 10 hits.']","First, consider the musical achievements of both ABBA and The Beatles: ABBA had 1 Billboard number 1 hit and 4 top 10 hits, while The Beatles had 20 Billboard number 1 hits and 34 top 10 hits. The comparison of their Billboard successes shows a significant difference in the impact and popularity of their music. Given the vast disparity in their chart achievements, calling ABBA the ""Swedish Beatles"" could be considered a preposterous claim as it does not accurately reflect the comparative success and influence of The Beatles in the music industry. The answer is 'True'.",True
Could a Jujutsu expert hypothetically defeat a Janissary?,"['Jujutsu is a form of unarmed combat.', 'Janissaries were the elite infantry of the Ottoman Empire.', 'Janissaries wore chain mail and armor and wielded sharp swords.']","First, consider the skills and equipment of both the Jujutsu expert and the Janissary: Jujutsu is a form of unarmed combat, which relies on grappling, joint locks, and throws. Janissaries, on the other hand, were elite infantry of the Ottoman Empire, known for their training, discipline, and heavy armor, including chain mail and sharp swords.

Next, analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages of each combatant: The Jujutsu expert would likely have superior skills in close-quarters combat and grappling, which could be effective against an opponent without armor. However, the Janissary's armor and weaponry would provide significant protection and offensive capabilities, making it difficult for the Jujutsu expert to land effective strikes or grapples.

Given these factors, it is difficult to predict a definitive outcome, as it would depend on various factors such as the skill level of the Jujutsu expert, the Janissary's combat experience, and the specific circumstances of the encounter. However, it is important to note that the Janissary's armor and weapons would likely give them a significant advantage in a direct confrontation. The answer is 'It is uncertain, but the Janissary may have an advantage due to their armor and weapons.'",False

These involuntary movements can significantly affect a person's coordination and control over their body movements. Next, consider the requirements of ballet: it is a performance dance known for its elegant and fluid motions, which require precision, grace, and control. Given that St. Vitus's Dance impairs the ability to perform controlled and fluid movements, it is unlikely that a person with this condition would be able to compete effectively in a ballet competition. The answer is 'False'.",False

Would a retail associate envy the retailer's CEO's pay?,"['The average retail CEO makes 14 million yearly.', 'Retail associates typically make between $8 and $13 hourly.']","First, consider the income of a retail CEO: the average retail CEO makes 14 million dollars yearly. Next, consider the income of a retail associate: they typically make between $8 and $13 hourly. To compare these incomes, let's calculate an approximate annual salary for a retail associate. Assuming a 40-hour work week and 52 weeks in a year, a retail associate making $10.50 per hour (the midpoint of the given range) would earn approximately $21,840 per year. Comparing this to the CEO's annual income of 14 million dollars, there is a significant disparity in earnings. Given the vast difference in income, it is reasonable to assume that a retail associate might indeed envy the retailer's CEO's pay. The answer is 'True'.",True

Are Brian Cranston and Saoirse Ronan's combined Emmy Awards a prime number?,"['Brian Cranston has won 6 Emmy Awards.', 'Saoirse Ronan has won 0 Emmy awards.', '6 is divisible by the following numbers: 1,2,3, and 6.']","First, consider the number of Emmy Awards won by Brian Cranston and Saoirse Ronan: Brian Cranston has won 6 Emmy Awards, and Saoirse Ronan has won 0 Emmy Awards. To find the combined total of Emmy Awards, add the two numbers together: 6 + 0 = 6. Next, determine if 6 is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, which means it is divisible by numbers other than just 1 and itself. Therefore, the combined total of Emmy Awards for Brian Cranston and Saoirse Ronan is not a prime number. The answer is 'False'.",False

Typically, major cities are not the primary destinations for nature escapes due to their urban environments and lack of extensive natural landscapes. However, San Francisco does have some natural attractions nearby, such as the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Muir Woods National Monument. While it may not be the first choice for a nature escape, it is possible for someone to visit San Francisco for a nature escape, especially if they combine city exploration with visits to nearby natural attractions. The answer is 'True', but with the understanding that it may not be the most typical or ideal location for a nature escape.",False
Can a carrot receive an organ transplant?,"['Organs are groups of tissues that perform a similar function.', 'The whole of a carrot is a root.', 'A root is a plant organ.', 'You cannot transplant the entire carrot into another carrot.']","First, consider the definition of an organ: it is a group of tissues that perform a similar function. In the context of plants, a carrot is a root, which is a type of plant organ. However, the question of organ transplant typically refers to the transplantation of organs between animals, particularly humans, where the organ is removed from one individual and placed into another to replace a failing organ and sustain life.

Since a carrot is a plant and not an animal, the concept of organ transplant as it applies to animals does not apply to carrots. Additionally, even if we consider the transplantation of plant organs, the entire carrot (root) cannot be transplanted into another carrot as it would not make sense in the context of plant biology and growth.

Therefore, the answer is 'False'. A carrot cannot receive an organ transplant in the way that is typically understood for animal organ transplants, and even within the context of plant biology, transplanting an entire carrot is not a viable or meaningful procedure.",False

Would a blooming onion be possible with a shallot?,"['A blooming onion is a dish for sharing, featuring a sliced and deep fried onion made to resemble petals.', 'A shallot is very small and would only make a few ""petals""']","First, consider the definition of a blooming onion: it is a dish for sharing, featuring a sliced and deep-fried onion made to resemble petals. The key aspect here is the size and structure of the onion that allows it to be sliced in a way that creates the petal-like appearance when fried. Next, consider the characteristics of a shallot: it is very small compared to a regular onion. Due to its small size, a shallot would only make a few ""petals"" and would not create the same visual and culinary effect as a larger onion. Therefore, a blooming onion made with a shallot would not be possible in the traditional sense, as it would not resemble the desired petal-like structure. The answer is 'False'.",False

Was Dr. Seuss a liar?,"[""Dr. Seuss was a writer and illustrator of children's books"", ""Dr. Seuss first published a children's book under the name of Dr. Seuss in 1937"", 'Dr. Seuss did not actually have a doctorate or equivalent degree until 1956']","First, consider the context provided: Dr. Seuss was a writer and illustrator of children's books, and he first published a children's book under the name of Dr. Seuss in 1937. However, he did not actually have a doctorate or equivalent degree until 1956. This means that he used the title ""Dr."" before he had earned the corresponding academic degree.

While using the title ""Dr."" without having a doctorate can be seen as misleading, it is not necessarily accurate to label Dr. Seuss as a ""liar."" The term ""liar"" implies intentional deceit, and it is unclear whether Dr. Seuss intended to deceive people about his qualifications. Additionally, his work as a children's author was not directly related to his academic credentials.

Therefore, based on the context provided, it is not appropriate to definitively label Dr. Seuss as a liar. The answer is 'False'.",True

Can Centurylink max internet plan upload 1000GB in a fortnight?,"['A fortnight refers to a period of two weeks.', ""Centurylink's max internet plan speed is 1,000MB per second."", '1000GB takes 2.5 hours to upload for every 1000MB speed.']","First, consider the time frame of a fortnight, which is two weeks, or 14 days. Next, note the upload speed of Centurylink's max internet plan, which is 1,000MB per second. Then, consider the time it takes to upload 1000GB at this speed, which is 2.5 hours for every 1000MB speed.

To calculate if 1000GB can be uploaded in a fortnight, we need to convert the upload speed to GB per second and then calculate the total time it would take to upload 1000GB. 

1,000MB per second is equivalent to 1GB per second (since 1GB = 1000MB). Therefore, at 1GB per second, it would take 1000 seconds to upload 1000GB. 

1000 seconds is approximately 0.278 hours (1000 / 3600). Since it takes 2.5 hours to upload 1000GB at this speed, and we are given that it takes 2.5 hours for every 1000MB speed, the time remains the same.

Now, to check if this time fits within a fortnight:

2.5 hours is equivalent to 0.1042 days (2.5 / 24). Since a fortnight is 14 days, it is clear that 2.5 hours is significantly less than a fortnight.

Therefore, the answer is 'True'. Centurylink's max internet plan can upload 1000GB in a fortnight.",True

The Roman army has more than double the number of workers compared to those who built the pyramids. However, building the pyramids required specific skills in engineering, construction, and logistics, which may not have been the primary expertise of a military force trained for warfare. Therefore, while the Roman Gallic Wars army had a larger number of individuals, they might not necessarily be more efficient or faster at building the pyramids due to the specialized nature of the task. The answer is 'Uncertain', as it depends on the extent to which the Roman army could adapt to and acquire the necessary construction skills.",False

Can first letter row of QWERTY keyboard spell a palindrome?,"['The first letter row of the QWERTY keyboard contains: QWERTYUIOP', 'A palindrome is a word that can be spelled the same backwords and forwards such as racecar and rotor.']","First, consider the definition of a palindrome: it is a word that can be spelled the same backward and forward. Next, examine the first letter row of the QWERTY keyboard, which contains the letters: QWERTYUIOP. To determine if this sequence can spell a palindrome, we need to find a subset of these letters that reads the same forward and backward.

One possible subset to check is the entire sequence: QWERTYUIOP. When spelled backward, it becomes: POIUYTREWQ. This sequence is not the same as the original, so it is not a palindrome.

However, we can try to find a shorter sequence within the row that might form a palindrome. For example, the sequence ""WOW"" can be formed using the letters W, O, and W from the row. When spelled backward, ""WOW"" remains ""WOW"", which is a palindrome.

Therefore, the answer is 'True' because a palindrome can be formed using the first letter row of the QWERTY keyboard.",True

Would Dante have hypothetically placed Nostradamus in 3rd Circle of Hell?,"['Nostradamus was a famous seer and court astrologer.', ""Dante's 3rd Circle of Hell is reserved for gluttons."", 'The 8th Circle of Hell is reserved for frauds.', ""Astrology was seen as a valuable skill during Dante's lifetime."", 'Dante places the mystic and prophet Joachim of Flora in the heaven of the sun.']","First, consider the context of Dante's Inferno: the 3rd Circle of Hell is reserved for gluttons, not for individuals associated with mysticism or prophecy. Nostradamus, being a famous seer and court astrologer, would not be categorized under gluttony. Instead, his profession as a seer and astrologer might suggest a placement related to his predictions or the perceived truthfulness of his work.

Next, consider the 8th Circle of Hell, which is reserved for frauds. While astrology was seen as a valuable skill during Dante's lifetime, it is possible that Dante might have viewed Nostradamus's predictions as deceptive or misleading, which could align with the 8th Circle's criteria.

However, it is also important to note that Dante placed the mystic and prophet Joachim of Flora in the heaven of the sun, indicating a positive view of prophecy and mysticism in some cases. This suggests that Dante's placement of individuals in Hell or Heaven was not solely based on their profession but also on the perceived morality and truthfulness of their actions and beliefs.

Given this context, it is difficult to definitively determine whether Dante would have placed Nostradamus in the 3rd Circle of Hell. It would depend on Dante's personal judgment of Nostradamus's work and its alignment with the sins punished in each circle of Hell. Therefore, the answer cannot be definitively determined as 'True' or 'False' without more specific information on Dante's views on Nostradamus's work.",False
Can numerologists become members of Royal Society?,"['The royal society fulfills a number of roles: promoting science and its benefits, recognizing excellence in science, supporting outstanding science, providing scientific advice for policy.', 'Numerology is a superstition and a pseudoscience that uses numbers to give the subject a veneer of scientific authority.']","First, consider the purpose and criteria for membership in the Royal Society: the society promotes science and its benefits, recognizes excellence in science, supports outstanding science, and provides scientific advice for policy. Next, evaluate the nature of numerology: it is a superstition and a pseudoscience that uses numbers to give the subject a veneer of scientific authority, which does not align with the rigorous scientific standards of the Royal Society. Therefore, it is unlikely that a numerologist would be recognized as a member of the Royal Society due to the non-scientific basis of numerology. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Edward II of England have been born without Vikings?,"['Edward II was King of England from 1307-1327.', 'Rollo was a Viking who became the first ruler of Normandy.', 'William the Conqueror was the first Norman King of England and the great-great-great-grandson of Rollo.', ""Edward II is related to William the Conqueror through Rollo's granddaughter's line (Empress Matilda).""]","First, consider the historical context: Edward II was King of England from 1307-1327, and his lineage can be traced back to William the Conqueror, who was the first Norman King of England. William the Conqueror was a descendant of Rollo, a Viking who became the first ruler of Normandy. Edward II is related to William the Conqueror through Rollo's granddaughter's line, Empress Matilda.

Given this lineage, it is clear that the presence of Vikings, specifically Rollo, had a significant impact on the genetic and historical background of Edward II. Without the Vikings, particularly Rollo and his descendants, the Norman conquest of England and the subsequent lineage that led to Edward II would not have occurred in the same way. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Edward II would not have been born without the influence of the Vikings. The answer is 'True'.",False

This means that in these cases, the cygnets do not have a genetic connection to the male raising them. Additionally, one-third of monogamous black swan pairs show extra-pair paternity, where the male aids the female in raising another male's offspring. In these situations, the cygnets are not genetically related to the male they are being raised by.

Given these factors, it is not typical for black swan cygnets to know both of their genetic parents, as the social and genetic structures of their family units can be quite complex and varied. The answer is 'False'.",False

Is it comfortable to wear sandals outside Esperanza Base?,"['Sandals are a type of footwear that leave parts of the foot exposed', 'Esperanza Base is located in Antarctica', 'Average temperatures in Antarctica range from -10.5C to 1.4C']","First, consider the nature of sandals as a type of footwear that leaves parts of the foot exposed. This design is typically suited for warm climates or indoor use where protection from the elements is not a primary concern. Next, consider the location of Esperanza Base, which is in Antarctica, a region known for its harsh and cold climate. The average temperatures in Antarctica range from -10.5°C to 1.4°C, which are far too cold for exposed skin, such as that left by wearing sandals. Therefore, it would not be comfortable, and it would likely be dangerous, to wear sandals outside Esperanza Base due to the extreme cold. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does welding with acetylene simulate the temperature of a star?,"['Acetylene is used for oxyacetylene welding ', 'An acetylene/oxygen flame burns at about 3,773 K ', 'The star Betelgeuse has a surface temperature of 3,500 K']","First, consider the temperature of an acetylene/oxygen flame, which burns at about 3,773 K. Next, compare this temperature to the surface temperature of the star Betelgeuse, which is 3,500 K. Since the flame temperature from welding with acetylene is higher than the surface temperature of Betelgeuse, it can be said that welding with acetylene simulates a temperature that is higher than that of Betelgeuse. However, it is important to note that there are many other stars with much higher surface temperatures, so while it may simulate the temperature of some stars, it does not simulate the temperature of all stars. The answer is 'True' in the context of Betelgeuse, but 'False' if considering stars with higher temperatures.",True

Is Norman Oklahoma named after a viking?,"['The Normans invaded England in 1066 and were originally vikings from Scandinavia.', 'Norman Oklahoma was first surveyed by land surveyor Abner Norman in the 1800s.', '1066 is said to be the end of the Viking Era.']","First, consider the origin of the name ""Norman"" in Norman, Oklahoma: it was first surveyed by land surveyor Abner Norman in the 1800s. The name appears to be derived from the surname of the surveyor, not directly from the historical Normans who invaded England in 1066. Although the historical Normans were originally Vikings from Scandinavia, there is no direct link between this historical context and the naming of Norman, Oklahoma. Therefore, Norman, Oklahoma is not named after a Viking but rather after Abner Norman, the land surveyor. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can every digit in Pi be memorized?,"['The digits of Pi are infinite. ', 'The human mind cannot hold an infinite amount of information.']","First, consider the nature of Pi: the digits of Pi are infinite, meaning they go on without end.

Was 1941 Operation Barbarossa related to The Crusades?,"['Operation Barbarossa referred to the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union.', 'Frederick Barbarosa was the Holy Roman Empire that drowned while marching his army to The Crusades.', 'The Holy Roman Empire was a medieval empire that ruled over lands including what became modern Germany.']","First, consider the context of both events: Operation Barbarossa was the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, while The Crusades were a series of religious wars in the medieval period, primarily fought by European Christians against Muslims for control of holy sites.

Next, note the connection between the names: Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor, was indeed associated with The Crusades, as he drowned while leading his army to join the Third Crusade. However, the naming of Operation Barbarossa after Frederick Barbarossa does not imply a direct historical or strategic connection to The Crusades.

Therefore, while the name ""Barbarossa"" links the two events through historical reference, the events themselves are distinct and unrelated in terms of their objectives and contexts. The answer is 'False'.",True
Can ham make a cut seal up quicker?,"['Salt helps cleanse the skin by displacing bacteria in a cut.', '1 Cup of ham contains 1.684 mg of sodium.', 'Salt is a mineral made up mostly of sodium chloride.']","First, consider the role of salt in wound healing: salt helps cleanse the skin by displacing bacteria in a cut, which can aid in preventing infection and promoting healing. Next, note that ham contains sodium, which is a component of salt (sodium chloride). However, the question is whether ham can make a cut seal up quicker, not whether salt can.

While salt can be beneficial in cleansing a wound, applying ham directly to a cut is not a recommended method of wound care. Ham is not sterile and could introduce additional bacteria to the wound, potentially causing infection rather than aiding healing. Additionally, the sodium content in ham is not in a form or concentration suitable for direct application to a wound.

Therefore, the answer is 'False'. Ham cannot make a cut seal up quicker; in fact, it could potentially harm the healing process by introducing bacteria and not providing the appropriate concentration of sodium for effective wound cleansing.",True

This indicates that he had a notable participation in a significant wrestling event. However, it's important to note that Drew Carey is primarily known as a comedian and actor, not a professional wrestler. Additionally, his induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011 was more for his celebrity status and contribution to the entertainment aspect of wrestling rather than his in-ring achievements. Therefore, while Drew Carey has a place in wrestling history due to his participation in the Royal Rumble and his Hall of Fame induction, his overall impact on the history of wrestling is relatively minor compared to professional wrestlers and key figures in the sport.

Would Othello be Shakespeare's play to buy Scheherazade most time with king?,"['Scheherazade was a character in Middle Eastern folklore that delayed her execution by telling the king long stories.', ""Shakespeare's play Othello contained 26,450 words."", ""Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play consisting of 4000 lines and 30,000 words.""]","First, consider the purpose of Scheherazade's storytelling: she used long stories to delay her execution by the king. Next, compare the lengths of Shakespeare's plays: Othello contains 26,450 words, while Hamlet is the longest with 40,000 words. Since Hamlet is longer than Othello, it would provide Scheherazade with more time to tell the story and delay her execution. Therefore, Othello would not be Shakespeare's play to buy Scheherazade the most time with the king. The answer is 'False'.",False
Does ancient Olympics crown fail to hide tonsure?,"['Tonsure refers to the religious hairstyle in which hair from the top of the head is shaved off.', 'Winners of the ancient Olympics were given a laurel crown to wear.', 'A laurel crown involves leaves arranged in a circle that cover only the edges of the head.']","First, consider the definition of tonsure: it is a religious hairstyle where hair from the top of the head is shaved off. Next, examine the nature of the laurel crown awarded to winners of the ancient Olympics: it is made of leaves arranged in a circle that cover only the edges of the head. Since the laurel crown does not cover the top of the head where tonsure would be evident, it would indeed fail to hide tonsure if a person with this hairstyle were to wear it. The answer is 'True'.",True

Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are, in fact, underweight.']","First, consider the characteristics of anorexia nervosa: it is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, food restriction, fear of gaining weight, and a strong desire to be thin. People with anorexia often see themselves as overweight even when they are underweight. Next, consider the case of Jon Brower Minnoch: he was the heaviest human being ever recorded, weighing 1,400 lb at his peak weight. This information clearly indicates that Minnoch did not suffer from anorexia nervosa, as his condition involved extreme weight gain rather than weight loss or restriction. The answer is 'False'.",False

In contrast, the Cassowary is known as the world's most dangerous bird, with a history of aggressive behavior and even fatalities involving humans and dogs. Given these characteristics, a Cassowary poses a significantly higher risk as a pet compared to a crane. The answer is 'False'.",False
Was proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works lucrative?,"['Proofreaders get paid a set rate based on the number of words in a document.', 'Edgar Allan Poe wrote many short stories including the Oval Portrait which is two pages in length.', ""Edgar Allan Poe's only complete novel: The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was a mere 166 pages."", ""A book like Jeyamohan's Venmurasu is 11,159 pages.""]","First, consider the payment structure for proofreaders: they typically get paid a set rate based on the number of words in a document. Next, analyze the length of Edgar Allan Poe's works: his short stories, such as ""The Oval Portrait,"" are only a few pages long, and his only complete novel, ""The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket,"" is 166 pages. In comparison, a significantly longer work like Jeyamohan's ""Venmurasu"" is 11,159 pages. Given the relatively short length of Poe's works compared to other literary works, the potential earnings from proofreading his works would likely be less lucrative than proofreading longer works. Therefore, the answer is 'False'.",False
Was Mozart accused of stealing from Richard Wagner?,"['Mozart died in 1791.', 'Richard Wagner was born in 1813.']","First, consider the timelines of Mozart and Richard Wagner: Mozart died in 1791, and Richard Wagner was born in 1813.

Does being good at guitar hero make you a good guitarist?,"['Guitar Hero is a game that features a guitar-shaped controller with buttons that the player must hit in time with a song.', 'Guitars as instruments do not have any buttons, but have strings that must be strummed in a particular way to create sound.']","First, consider the differences between playing Guitar Hero and playing a real guitar: Guitar Hero is a game that uses a controller with buttons, while a real guitar requires strumming strings and fretting notes without buttons. The skills required for each are quite different. Being good at Guitar Hero involves rhythm and hand-eye coordination specific to the game's mechanics, whereas playing a real guitar involves finger dexterity, musical theory, and the ability to create actual music. Therefore, being good at Guitar Hero does not necessarily make you a good guitarist, as the skills and techniques involved in each activity are distinct. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did any citizen of San Antonio vote for Boris Johnson?,"['San Antonio is a city in Texas in the United States of America', 'Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister of the UK', 'Only UK and commonwealth citizens may vote in UK elections']","First, consider the locations and political contexts: San Antonio is a city in Texas, USA, and Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister of the UK. Next, note the eligibility criteria for voting in UK elections: only UK and commonwealth citizens may vote in these elections. Since citizens of San Antonio, being in the United States, are not UK or commonwealth citizens, they would not be eligible to vote in UK elections, including those involving Boris Johnson. Therefore, no citizen of San Antonio could have voted for Boris Johnson. The answer is 'False'.",False

Wodehouse be taught in second grade?,"['Second graders are often aged seven or eight.', 'The works of Wodehouse are intended for an adult audience.']","First, consider the age and reading level of second graders: they are typically aged seven or eight, which means their reading comprehension and maturity levels are still developing. Next, consider the intended audience of P. G. Wodehouse's works: they are meant for an adult audience, which implies that the content and themes may be too complex or inappropriate for young children. Given these factors, it is unlikely that P. G. Wodehouse would be taught in second grade, as the material is not suitable for the age group's developmental stage. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can Tame Impala's studio band play a proper game of Hot Potato?,"['Hot Potato is a game in which two or more people toss a potato until the music stops.', 'Tame Impala is a band with one member, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker.']","First, consider the nature of the game Hot Potato: it requires two or more people to toss a potato until the music stops. Next, examine the composition of Tame Impala: it is a band with one member, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker.

Can children become lieutenants?,"['Lieutenant the second junior-most or in some cases the junior-most commissioned officer in the armed forces, fire services, police, and other organizations of many nations.', 'Many gangs use military rankings to describe their internal heirarchy.', 'Many young children are inducted into gangs with heirarchies.', 'Children can grow up to be whatever they want to be. ']","First, consider the definition of ""lieutenant"": it is a commissioned officer in the armed forces, fire services, police, and other organizations. Typically, this role requires a certain level of maturity, education, and training, which children do not possess. However, context 2 and 3 mention that some gangs use military rankings and may induct young children into their hierarchies. In such cases, children could potentially hold the title of ""lieutenant"" within the gang's internal hierarchy, although this is not a formal or recognized military position. Context 4 suggests that children can aspire to become lieutenants in the future as they grow up and meet the necessary requirements. Therefore, while children cannot become lieutenants in formal military or law enforcement organizations, they could hold a similar title in a gang's hierarchy or aspire to become one when they are adults. The answer is 'False' for formal military or law enforcement organizations, but 'True' in the context of certain gangs.",True
Is the title of Shirley Bassey's 1971 diamond song a true statement?,"['Shirley Bassey recorded the song Diamonds are Forever in 1971,', 'Over time, diamonds degrade and turn into graphite.', 'Graphite is the same chemical composition found in pencils.']","First, consider the title of Shirley Bassey's 1971 song, ""Diamonds are Forever."" This statement implies that diamonds are eternal and do not change over time. However, the context provides information that contradicts this statement: diamonds actually degrade and turn into graphite over time. Graphite is a form of carbon, the same chemical composition found in pencils, which indicates that diamonds are not forever as they eventually transform into another substance. Therefore, the title of the song is not a true statement based on the provided context. The answer is 'False'.",False

The caterpillar engages with Alice by making letters out of the smoke he blows. While the act of smoking is depicted, it is not necessarily portrayed as enjoyable for the character of Alice herself. The interaction with the caterpillar and the smoking is more of a surreal and curious event rather than an endorsement of tobacco use as enjoyable. Therefore, the answer is 'False' as the text does not explicitly make tobacco use seem enjoyable to the reader or to Alice.",True
Is overfeeding Lactobacillus unwise for people without dental insurance?,"['Lactobacillus species convert sugars they digest to lactic acid ', 'The lactic acid of some Lactobacillus species is associated with tooth decay', 'Dental procedures can be expensive without insurance']","First, consider the effects of Lactobacillus on dental health: Lactobacillus species convert sugars they digest into lactic acid, and some of this lactic acid is associated with tooth decay. Next, consider the financial implications of dental care without insurance: dental procedures can be expensive without coverage. Overfeeding Lactobacillus could potentially increase the production of lactic acid, which might lead to more tooth decay. For individuals without dental insurance, this could result in the need for costly dental treatments. Therefore, it would be unwise for people without dental insurance to overfeed Lactobacillus due to the potential increase in tooth decay and the associated financial burden of dental care. The answer is 'True'.",True
Can Simon Cowell vote for the next Supreme Court judge?,"['The Supreme Court is the highest court in the USA.', 'Simon Cowell is a British talent competition judge.', 'Members of the Supreme Court are appointed, rather than elected.']","First, consider the process for appointing Supreme Court judges: they are appointed, not elected, in the United States. Next, consider the citizenship and role of Simon Cowell: he is a British citizen and a talent competition judge, not a U.S. citizen or a member of the U.S. government. Since Supreme Court judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and Simon Cowell does not hold a position in the U.S. government that would grant him the authority to vote on such appointments, he cannot vote for the next Supreme Court judge.

Would a duck ever need a Caesarean section?,"['A Caesarean section is a medical procedure in which surgery is performed to remove the baby from inside the mother.', 'Ducks do not give live birth, they lay eggs.']","First, consider the definition of a Caesarean section: it is a medical procedure in which surgery is performed to remove the baby from inside the mother. This procedure is typically used for mammals that give live birth. Next, consider the reproductive process of ducks: ducks do not give live birth; instead, they lay eggs. Since ducks do not have live offspring inside them that need to be surgically removed, the need for a Caesarean section does not arise in their case. The answer is 'False'.",False
Can a cell fit inside of a shoebox?,"['The average shoebox is around 14 inches by 10 inches by 5 inches', 'The average eukaryotic cell is between 1 and 100 micrometers in diameter']","First, consider the dimensions of a shoebox: the average shoebox is around 14 inches by 10 inches by 5 inches. This provides a volume of approximately 700 cubic inches. Next, consider the size of a eukaryotic cell: the average eukaryotic cell is between 1 and 100 micrometers in diameter. To compare these sizes, convert the measurements to a common unit. There are 25,400 micrometers in an inch. Therefore, the smallest eukaryotic cell (1 micrometer) is 0.00003937 inches in diameter, and the largest (100 micrometers) is 0.003937 inches in diameter.

Given these dimensions, it is clear that a cell, regardless of its size, is significantly smaller than the space available in a shoebox. Therefore, a cell can easily fit inside of a shoebox. The answer is 'True'.",True

Pikachu is a Pokémon, and Pokémon rely on evolution to transform into stronger forms. While it is a fictional scenario, if we consider the implications of Darwin's theory on the Pokémon world, it could be inferred that Pikachu, as a Pokémon that benefits from the concept of evolution, might have a positive association with the ideas that Charles Darwin contributed to the understanding of evolution. However, it's important to note that this is a speculative and fictional interpretation, as Pikachu is not a sentient being capable of understanding or appreciating historical figures or scientific theories. The answer is 'True' in a fictional and speculative sense, but it's not a literal or factual statement.",True
Could all the unemployed people due to 1933 Great Depression fit in Tiger Stadium?,"['There were approximately 15 million people unemployed in 1933 due to the Great Depression.', 'In the 1930s Tiger Stadium had a capacity around 50,000.']","First, consider the number of unemployed people during the 1933 Great Depression: there were approximately 15 million people unemployed. Next, consider the capacity of Tiger Stadium in the 1930s: it was around 50,000. To determine if all the unemployed people could fit in Tiger Stadium, compare these two numbers.

The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which is signed by most UN member states, including the U.K., provides for this immunity. The United States Secretary of State, as a high-ranking diplomat, would likely be granted diplomatic immunity in the U.K. due to the U.S. and the U.K. both being signatories of the Vienna Convention. Therefore, if the United States Secretary of State were to commit a crime in the U.K., they would not be arrested due to diplomatic immunity. The answer is 'True'.",True
Does open heart surgery finish before entirety of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake?,"[""The American Ballet theatre's Swan Lake has a run time of 145 minutes."", 'The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute states that a coronary artery bypass takes 3 to 6 hours']","First, consider the duration of both events: the American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake has a run time of 145 minutes, which is approximately 2.42 hours. Open heart surgery, specifically a coronary artery bypass, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, takes between 3 to 6 hours. Since the shortest duration of open heart surgery (3 hours) is longer than the entire performance of Swan Lake (2.42 hours), open heart surgery would not finish before the entirety of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake. The answer is 'False'.",False

Lieutenant Richards, a pirate, was second-in-command of the ship Bonnet's Revenge and had many duties, including being in charge of the ship. In the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies, the first lieutenant is also the second-in-command and has similar responsibilities. Both positions involve significant leadership and command duties.

Next, examine Rand Paul's statements on immigration: in May 2010, he called for an electronic fence to keep out immigrants and deplored amnesty in any form. However, in 2013, he expressed support for undocumented immigrants being granted legal status. This represents a significant shift in his stance on immigration policy. Given this change in position, Rand Paul could be considered guilty of using a catch-phrase similar to the one used to attack John Kerry in 2004, as he himself has demonstrated a ""flip-flop"" in policy. The answer is 'True'.",True
Was Robert Downey Jr. a good role model as a young man?,"['As a young man, Robert Downey Jr. struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.', 'Robert Downey Jr. shot a gun out of a car window while doing drugs as a young adult.']","First, consider the context provided about Robert Downey Jr.'s behavior as a young man: he struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and engaged in dangerous activities, such as shooting a gun out of a car window while under the influence. These actions are generally not considered positive or exemplary behavior. Therefore, based on the information provided, it would be accurate to say that Robert Downey Jr. was not a good role model as a young man. The answer is 'False'.",False

Melania Trump was a model before becoming the First Lady of the United States. Olga Kurylenko is a professional actress who also works as a model. While both women have experience in modeling, Olga Kurylenko's primary profession is acting, whereas Melania Trump's primary profession was modeling before her role as First Lady.

Next, understand the definition of atheism: it is the absence of belief in a deity. Since Catholics, including Mother Theresa, believe in the Holy Trinity, which is a representation of God, it is clear that Mother Theresa's beliefs were in direct contrast to atheism. Therefore, the answer is 'False'; Mother Theresa was not a follower of atheism.",False
Was Jackson Pollock trained by Leonardo da Vinci?,"['Leonardo lived during the Italian Renaissance in the 17th century.', 'Jackson Pollock lived during the 20th century.']","First, consider the time periods in which Leonardo da Vinci and Jackson Pollock lived: Leonardo lived during the Italian Renaissance in the 17th century, while Jackson Pollock lived during the 20th century.

Did Confederate States Army influence West Point fashion?,"['The Confederate States Army was clad in cadet gray uniforms.', 'West Point uniforms are cadet gray and white.', 'Confederate States Army uniforms contained Generally, the uniform jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a six to nine button front and hat.', ' West Point uniforms contain a standing collar, white trousers, and black shakos (known as a ""tarbucket hat"" in U.S. Army nomenclature).']","First, consider the uniforms of both the Confederate States Army and West Point: the Confederate States Army wore cadet gray uniforms, and West Point uniforms are also cadet gray and white. However, the specific details of the uniforms differ: Confederate uniforms typically had a single-breasted jacket with a six to nine button front, while West Point uniforms feature a standing collar, white trousers, and black shakos (tarbucket hat). Although there is a similarity in the color (cadet gray), the overall design and elements of the West Point uniform do not directly reflect the Confederate States Army uniform. Therefore, while there may be a historical connection due to the shared color, it is not accurate to say that the Confederate States Army significantly influenced West Point fashion in terms of uniform design. The answer is 'False'.",True

Next, examine the results of the 1980 United States presidential election: Ronald Reagan won 489 electoral votes and 44 states, while Jimmy Carter won only 49 electoral votes and 6 states. The margin between the two candidates is significant, with Reagan clearly dominating the electoral vote and the number of states won. Therefore, the 1980 United States presidential election cannot be considered a photo finish, as the results were not close enough to require detailed examination. The answer is 'False'.",False

Next, understand the concept of a blacklist: it is a list of individuals who are considered unacceptable and should be avoided or excluded. Michael Vick, a former football player, has a history of involvement in a dog fighting enterprise for which he served 21 months in prison. Given PETA's stance on animal welfare and the severity of Vick's actions against animals, it is reasonable to assume that Michael Vick could be on PETA's hypothetical blacklist.

This means that Mary, Queen of Scots had French ancestry through her mother. However, to determine if Scottish people are descended from her and thus part French, we need to consider how her lineage has been passed down. Mary, Queen of Scots had one surviving son, James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England. The genetic impact of Mary's French ancestry on the broader Scottish population would depend on how many people in Scotland are directly descended from her and her son. Given the limited number of direct descendants and the dilution of her genetic contribution over generations, it is unlikely that a significant portion of the Scottish population would be considered part French solely due to this lineage.

Next, compare this to the dimensions of a standard 30-inch oven, which is approximately 25 inches wide, 16 inches high, and 16 inches deep.

To determine if a honey badger would fit inside the oven, we need to consider both the length and height of the honey badger. The maximum body length of a honey badger is 30 inches, which could potentially fit within the width of the oven. However, the height of the oven is only 16 inches, and the shoulder height of a honey badger is up to 11 inches. This means that a honey badger would likely be too tall to fit comfortably inside the oven, even if its body length could fit within the width.

Therefore, the answer is 'False'. A honey badger would not fit inside an oven due to its height.",True

Would an aerodynamic cactus benefit from more frequently closed stomata?,"['Cactus spines help the plant retain water by reducing air flow around the plant', 'Aerodynamic objects have smooth surfaces ', 'Crassulacean acid metabolism is used by cactuses ', ""Crassulacean acid metabolism is when a plant's stomata stay closed during daylight or times of drought to prevent water loss""]","First, consider the context provided: 
1. Cactus spines help the plant retain water by reducing air flow around the plant.
2. Aerodynamic objects have smooth surfaces.
3. Crassulacean acid metabolism is used by cactuses.
4. Crassulacean acid metabolism is when a plant's stomata stay closed during daylight or times of drought to prevent water loss.

Next, analyze the relationship between aerodynamics and stomata closure:
- An aerodynamic cactus would have a smoother surface, potentially increasing air flow around the plant.
- Cactuses use Crassulacean acid metabolism, which involves keeping stomata closed during daylight or drought to retain water.

Given these points, an aerodynamic cactus might experience increased air flow, which could lead to more water loss. To counteract this, more frequent closure of stomata would help the cactus retain water by reducing transpiration. Therefore, an aerodynamic cactus would likely benefit from more frequently closed stomata to maintain water balance in the face of potentially increased air flow. The answer is 'True'.",True

Processing Lapis Lazuli into Ultramarine is the most expensive of color processes. Given this information, it can be concluded that the production of ultramarine, a specific shade of blue, is indeed expensive. However, it is important to note that not all shades of blue are the most expensive colors in the world; rather, it is ultramarine, derived from Lapis Lazuli, that holds this distinction. Therefore, the answer is 'True' for the specific case of ultramarine, but not for all shades of blue.",True
Do women often need new shoes during their pregnancy?,"['Pregnancy can cause swelling in the feet and legs.', 'For safety and comfort, one needs to get new shoes if the size of their feet change.']","First, consider the effects of pregnancy: it can cause swelling in the feet and legs. This swelling can lead to changes in the size of a woman's feet. Second, consider the need for safety and comfort: if the size of one's feet changes, it is necessary to get new shoes that fit properly. Given that pregnancy often results in such changes, it is reasonable to conclude that women often need new shoes during their pregnancy to accommodate the changes in their foot size and ensure comfort and safety. The answer is 'True'.",True

The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Seroquel be the first treatment recommended by a doctor to someone with depression?,"['Seroquel is a powerful drug that is prescribed for bipolar disorder.', 'Seroquel has sedating effects and can increase feelings of depression.', ""Depression is usually treated by SSRI's. "", 'Seroquel is an atypical antipsychotic.']","First, consider the primary uses and effects of Seroquel: it is a powerful drug prescribed for bipolar disorder and is an atypical antipsychotic. It also has sedating effects and can potentially increase feelings of depression. Next, consider the typical treatment for depression: it is usually treated with SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), which are specifically designed to address depression. Given that Seroquel is not primarily used for depression and can even exacerbate depressive symptoms, it is unlikely to be the first treatment recommended by a doctor for someone with depression. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is University of Pittsburgh easier to enter than FBI?,"['The University of Pittsburgh has around a 60% acceptance rate.', 'The FBI estimated accepting 900 agents out of 16000 applicants in 2019.']","First, consider the acceptance rates of both the University of Pittsburgh and the FBI. The University of Pittsburgh has an acceptance rate of around 60%, which means that approximately 6 out of 10 applicants are accepted. In contrast, the FBI accepted 900 agents out of 16,000 applicants in 2019, which translates to an acceptance rate of approximately 5.6%.

To calculate the FBI's acceptance rate:
(900 / 16000) * 100 = 5.6%

Comparing these rates, the University of Pittsburgh has a significantly higher acceptance rate than the FBI. Therefore, it is easier to enter the University of Pittsburgh than to become an FBI agent. The answer is 'True'.",True

However, if each astronaut attempted to ride the unicycle individually, they might face difficulty as unicycling requires a specific set of skills and balance, which they may not have developed during their astronaut training. The answer is 'True', as they would likely have difficulty riding a unicycle due to the constraints of the vehicle and the specialized skill required.",True
Is Shakespeare famous because of the infinitive form?,"['Shakespeare wrote the play Hamlet', ""Hamlet contains one of Shakespeare's most famous passages, Hamlet's soliloquy"", ""Hamlet's soliloquy begins with the line 'To be or not to be', which uses the infinitive form""]","First, consider the reasons for Shakespeare's fame: he is renowned for his plays, including ""Hamlet,"" which contains the famous soliloquy beginning with the line ""To be or not to be."" This line uses the infinitive form of the verb ""to be."" However, while this line is famous, it is not the sole reason for Shakespeare's fame. His fame is attributed to his overall contribution to literature, including his innovative use of language, complex characters, and profound themes. Therefore, while the use of the infinitive form in ""To be or not to be"" is a notable aspect of his work, it is not the primary reason for his fame. The answer is 'False'.",True

Could Bob Marley's children hypothetically win tug of war against Kublai Khan's children?,"['Bob Marley had 9 children.', 'Kublai Khan had 23 children.', ""Many of Bob Marley's children became singers, and followed his themes of peace and love."", 'The children of Kublai Khan followed in his footsteps and were fierce warlords.']","First, consider the number of children each historical figure had: Bob Marley had 9 children, while Kublai Khan had 23 children. The sheer number of Kublai Khan's children gives them a significant advantage in a tug of war, as more participants can provide more pulling power. Additionally, the context mentions that the children of Kublai Khan were fierce warlords, which suggests they might have been physically strong and trained in combat, further enhancing their potential in a tug of war. On the other hand, Bob Marley's children, who became singers and followed themes of peace and love, might not have the same physical prowess or training in strength-based activities. Therefore, hypothetically, Kublai Khan's children would likely win a tug of war against Bob Marley's children due to their greater numbers and potentially stronger physical abilities. The answer is 'False'.",False

']","First, consider the definition of ""multicultural"": it refers to a blend of several cultures within one organism. In the context of Africanized bees, we need to understand their origin and composition. Africanized bees, also known as killer bees, are a result of crossbreeding between East African lowland honey bees and European honey bee subspecies, including the Italian honey bee and the Iberian honey bee. This crossbreeding has led to a hybrid species that exhibits traits from multiple original bee populations.

Given that Africanized bees are a mix of different honey bee subspecies, they can be considered a blend of genetic traits from multiple sources. However, it's important to note that the term ""multicultural"" is typically used in the context of human societies and cultures, not organisms. While Africanized bees are a result of crossbreeding and exhibit a mix of genetic traits, using the term ""multicultural"" to describe them might not be entirely accurate or appropriate, as it is not commonly applied to non-human organisms.

Therefore, while Africanized bees are a mix of different honey bee subspecies, it might be more accurate to describe them as a hybrid or crossbred species rather than using the term ""multicultural,"" which is more commonly associated with human cultural diversity. The answer is 'False' if we strictly apply the human cultural context of ""multicultural,"" but 'True' if we interpret the term loosely to mean a blend of genetic traits from different sources.",True

Is Christianity better for global warming than Satanism?,"['Global warming happens because CO2 is released into the atmosphere and warms it up.', 'Humans release two tons of carbon dioxide a year.', 'Reducing the population will lead to a reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere.', 'The Christian Crusades caused the deaths of nearly three million people.', 'In 1980s and 1990s there were allegations of Satanic ritual deaths, though only a few cases were substantiated.']","First, consider the factors contributing to global warming: the release of CO2 into the atmosphere, which is primarily due to human activities. The context mentions that humans release two tons of carbon dioxide a year. 

Next, consider the impact of population size on CO2 emissions: reducing the population could potentially lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions. 

Now, analyze the historical events related to Christianity and Satanism: the Christian Crusades caused the deaths of nearly three million people, while allegations of Satanic ritual deaths in the 1980s and 1990s were few and mostly unsubstantiated. 

Based on this information, it appears that Christianity, through the Crusades, has had a more significant impact on reducing the population than Satanism, which could theoretically lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions. However, this is a very narrow and ethically questionable perspective to consider when evaluating the impact of religious beliefs on global warming. 

In reality, the impact of religious beliefs on global warming is more complex and multifaceted, involving factors such as environmental stewardship, resource consumption, and energy use. It is not accurate or fair to simply state that one religion is ""better"" for global warming than another based solely on historical events that led to population reduction. 

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Is Christianity better for global warming than Satanism?"" is not straightforward and requires a more nuanced analysis of the broader implications of religious beliefs on environmental practices and policies.",True

Can an elite runner circle the Pyrenees in one day?,"['The Pyrenees mountains are 305 miles wide.', 'An elite runner can cover 100 miles in around 12 hours.']","First, consider the distance of the Pyrenees mountains: they are 305 miles wide. Next, consider the speed of an elite runner: they can cover 100 miles in around 12 hours. To determine if an elite runner can circle the Pyrenees in one day (24 hours), we need to calculate if they can cover 305 miles within this timeframe.

If an elite runner can cover 100 miles in 12 hours, they would theoretically cover 200 miles in 24 hours (2 x 12 hours = 24 hours). However, this still leaves 105 miles (305 - 200 = 105) unaccounted for. Even if we assume the runner could maintain their pace for an additional 12 hours, they would only cover an additional 100 miles, which is still 5 miles short of the total distance.

Additionally, running 305 miles in 24 hours is an extreme feat that would likely require a pace faster than the runner's typical 100-mile pace, and it would also depend on factors such as terrain, weather conditions, and the runner's endurance.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unlikely that an elite runner could circle the Pyrenees in one day. The answer is 'False'.",False

Would human race go extinct without chlorophyll?,"['Chlorophyll is a pigment in plants responsible for photosynthesis.', 'Photosynthesis is the process by which plants release oxygen into the atmosphere.', 'Humans need oxygen to live.']","First, consider the role of chlorophyll: it is a pigment in plants that is essential for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (food) and release oxygen as a byproduct. Humans and other animals rely on this oxygen for respiration, which is critical for sustaining life.

Without chlorophyll, plants would not be able to perform photosynthesis, leading to a significant decrease in oxygen production. This would disrupt the balance of oxygen in the atmosphere, making it difficult for humans and other oxygen-dependent species to survive.

While it is unlikely that the human race would go extinct immediately without chlorophyll, as there are other sources of oxygen and ways to produce it (such as through certain types of algae and bacteria), the long-term absence of chlorophyll and the subsequent decline in oxygen levels would pose a severe threat to human survival.

Therefore, the answer is 'True' that the human race would face extinction without chlorophyll, although the process might not be immediate and could depend on the adaptability and technological advancements of humans in response to such a crisis.",True

Would eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market be profitable for a steel company?,"['62% of bulk carriers are built in Japan', 'Bulk carrier hulls are made of steel']","First, consider the context provided: 62% of bulk carriers are built in Japan, and bulk carrier hulls are made of steel. This indicates that there is a significant demand for steel in the construction of bulk carriers, primarily in Japan. If a steel company could eliminate competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market, it could potentially have a monopoly on supplying steel for the majority of bulk carrier construction.

However, it's important to consider the implications of eliminating competition. Monopolies can lead to higher prices and potentially lower quality of products, which could negatively impact the market in the long term. Additionally, government regulations and antitrust laws may prevent a company from monopolizing a market.

In the short term, a steel company might see increased profits due to the lack of competition and the high demand for steel in bulk carrier construction. However, in the long term, the sustainability and profitability of such a scenario would depend on various factors, including market regulations, customer response to price increases, and the company's ability to maintain quality and efficiency.

Therefore, while eliminating competition might seem initially profitable, it is not guaranteed to be a sustainable or legal strategy. The answer is 'Uncertain' due to the potential legal and market implications of monopolizing the market.",True

Would it be possible to fit a football field in Alcatraz Island?,"['Alcatraz is 511 meters by 180 meters', 'A football field is 91 meters by 48 meters']","First, consider the dimensions of Alcatraz Island: it is 511 meters by 180 meters. Next, compare these dimensions to those of a football field: a football field is 91 meters by 48 meters. To determine if a football field can fit within Alcatraz Island, calculate the area of both:

- Area of Alcatraz Island = 511 meters * 180 meters = 91,980 square meters
- Area of a football field = 91 meters * 48 meters = 4,368 square meters

Now, divide the area of Alcatraz Island by the area of a football field to see how many football fields could theoretically fit:

91,980 square meters / 4,368 square meters ≈ 21.06

This calculation suggests that approximately 21 football fields could fit within the area of Alcatraz Island. However, this does not account for the shape of the island and the fact that it is not a flat, rectangular space. The actual feasibility of fitting a football field on the island would depend on the specific contours and obstacles of the island. Therefore, while it is theoretically possible based on area calculations, practical considerations might limit the actual ability to fit a football field on Alcatraz Island. The answer is 'Theoretically possible, but practical considerations might limit it'.",True

Could a markhor give birth three times in a single year?,"['The gestation period of a markhor lasts 135–170 days.', 'There are 365 days in a year.']","First, consider the gestation period of a markhor: it lasts 135–170 days. This is the time it takes for a markhor to give birth after becoming pregnant. Next, consider the number of days in a year: there are 365 days. To determine if a markhor could give birth three times in a single year, we need to calculate the minimum and maximum number of days required for three gestation periods.

Minimum number of days for three gestations: 135 days * 3 = 405 days
Maximum number of days for three gestations: 170 days * 3 = 510 days

Would Iris (mythology) and Hermes hypothetically struggle at a UPS job?,"['UPS is the number one delivery/courier service according to 2019 sales.', 'Iris is the goddess of the rainbow and serves as a messenger of the gods in Greek mythology.', 'Hermes in Greek mythology was a god that functioned as the emissary and messenger of the gods.']","First, consider the roles of Iris and Hermes in Greek mythology: Iris is the goddess of the rainbow and serves as a messenger of the gods, while Hermes is also a messenger god, known for his speed and communication skills. Next, consider the nature of a UPS job, which primarily involves delivery and courier services, tasks that require efficient communication and transportation. Given that both Iris and Hermes are mythological figures known for their abilities as messengers, it is reasonable to assume that they would excel in a UPS job due to their inherent skills in delivering messages and their supernatural abilities, which would likely enhance their performance in such a role. The answer is 'False'.",False
Would Doctor Strange like the Pittsburgh Steelers logo?,"['The Pittsburgh Steelers logo features patches of red, gold and blue', ""Doctor Strange's costume uses the colors red, gold and blue""]","First, consider the colors associated with both Doctor Strange and the Pittsburgh Steelers logo: Doctor Strange's costume uses the colors red, gold, and blue, and the Steelers logo also features patches of red, gold, and blue.

Does the human stomach destroy a bee if ingested?,"['Bees have an outer protective exoskeleton made of chitin, a polymer of glucose.', 'The human stomach releases harsh acids that break down materials.', 'The human stomach breaks down glucose in about 33 hours.']","First, consider the composition of a bee's exoskeleton, which is made of chitin, a polymer of glucose. Next, consider the function of the human stomach, which releases harsh acids to break down materials. While the stomach can break down glucose, which is a component of chitin, the process is not immediate and takes about 33 hours. The chitin in the bee's exoskeleton is a complex structure that may not be completely broken down by stomach acids alone, especially considering the time it takes to break down glucose. Additionally, the physical presence of the bee's body, including its exoskeleton, venom sac, and stinger, could pose a risk of injury to the stomach lining. Therefore, while the human stomach can break down some components of the bee, it is likely that a bee ingested whole would not be completely destroyed and could potentially cause harm. The answer is 'False'.",True
Can all of Snow White's dwarfs play a game of 7 Wonders simultaneously?,"['The fairy tale character Snow White was friends with seven dwarfs.', 'The board game 7 Wonders is for 2 to 7 players.']","First, consider the number of dwarfs in Snow White's story: there are seven dwarfs. Next, consider the number of players required for the board game 7 Wonders: it can accommodate 2 to 7 players. Since there are exactly seven dwarfs, and the game can support up to seven players, all of Snow White's dwarfs can play a game of 7 Wonders simultaneously. The answer is 'True'.",True
Does the texture of leaves remain the same independent of their coloring changing?,"['When leaves turn colors like red, yellow, or brown, they start being cut off from their main supply of nutrients and moisture.', 'As leaves change colors, they become dry and brittle.', 'Leaves tend to be supple and soft when they are green.']","First, consider the changes that occur in leaves as their color changes: when leaves turn colors like red, yellow, or brown, they start being cut off from their main supply of nutrients and moisture. This process leads to a change in the texture of the leaves. As mentioned, when leaves change colors, they become dry and brittle, which is a significant change from their supple and soft state when they are green. Therefore, the texture of leaves does not remain the same independent of their coloring changing; it changes from supple and soft to dry and brittle. The answer is 'False'.",False

Could Christopher Nolan's movies finance Cyprus's entire GDP?,"['The films of Christopher Nolan have grossed around 4.7 billion at the box office.', 'The GDP of Cyprus was 24.96 billion in 2018.']","First, consider the total box office earnings of Christopher Nolan's films: they have grossed around 4.7 billion dollars. Next, compare this amount to the GDP of Cyprus: in 2018, Cyprus had a GDP of 24.96 billion dollars. Since the total earnings from Christopher Nolan's movies are significantly less than the GDP of Cyprus, it is not possible for his movies to finance Cyprus's entire GDP. The answer is 'False'.",False

Can you give at least one word from the Torah to all residents of Bunkie Louisiana?,"['Torah scrolls must be duplicated precisely by a trained scribe.', 'The Torah has a total of 8,674 words.', 'The population of Bunkie Louisiana is 3,939 people according to a 2018 census.']","First, consider the constraints and context provided: the Torah has a total of 8,674 words, and the population of Bunkie, Louisiana, is 3,939 people. The Torah is a sacred text in Judaism, and its words are considered holy. While it is possible to share a word from the Torah with the residents of Bunkie, doing so would not necessarily be meaningful or appropriate without context or understanding of the religious significance of the text. However, if we are to simply address the feasibility of sharing a word from the Torah with all residents, it is technically possible as the number of words in the Torah exceeds the number of residents in Bunkie. Therefore, the answer is 'True', acknowledging the feasibility but not the appropriateness or depth of such an action.",True
Could the Dominican Order hypothetically defeat Blessed Gerard's order?,"['The Dominican Order is a Catholic group of friars that several priestly vows.', 'Blessed Gerard was the founder of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Knights Hospitaller).', ' The Order of St John of Jerusalem (Knights Hospitaller) were a well trained Catholic military order that fought in the Crusades.']","First, consider the nature of both orders: The Dominican Order is a Catholic group of friars that take several priestly vows, focusing on preaching and education. Blessed Gerard's Order, the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Knights Hospitaller), was a well-trained Catholic military order that fought in the Crusades. The primary function of the Dominican Order is not military but rather spiritual and intellectual, while the Knights Hospitaller were specifically trained for military combat.

Given the context, it is unlikely that the Dominican Order could hypothetically defeat Blessed Gerard's Order, as the latter was a military order with significant combat experience and training, whereas the Dominican Order does not have a comparable military focus or expertise. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Zorro carve his name into items regularly?,"['Zorro was known for using his weapon to leave a mark wherever he went.', 'The mark Zorro left was the first initial of his name and nothing more.']","First, consider the context provided about Zorro: he was known for using his weapon to leave a mark wherever he went. This mark was the first initial of his name, which is a stylized ""Z."" While Zorro did leave a mark that symbolized his name, it was not the full name ""Zorro"" but just the initial ""Z."" Therefore, Zorro did not regularly carve his full name into items, but he did leave a symbolic representation of his name. The answer is 'False'.",False

Later, in 2005, Disney World's Animal Kingdom opened Expedition Everest, which featured a more realistic and scarier version of the Yeti. Both of these attractions are associated with Disney theme parks and include a Yeti character. Therefore, the answer is 'True', there is a Yeti associated with Disney theme parks.",True
Is grief always obvious when it is being experienced?,"['Grief has no set external representation. ', 'People who are grieving may laugh, cry, or even seem angry.']","First, consider the nature of grief: it has no set external representation, meaning that the outward expression of grief can vary greatly among individuals. People who are grieving may exhibit a range of emotions, including laughing, crying, or appearing angry. This variability in expression suggests that grief is not always obvious when it is being experienced, as it can manifest in different ways and be hidden or misinterpreted. The answer is 'False'.",False

Since Bill Nye was born 11 years after Roosevelt's last election, it is impossible for him to have voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did either side score a touchdown during the Football War?,"['The Football War was a war in 1969 between Honduras and El Salvador', 'The Football War was caused in part by rioting during a FIFA Cup qualifying match', 'The FIFA Cup is a soccer tournament', 'Touchdowns are scored in American football']","First, consider the context of the Football War: it was a war in 1969 between Honduras and El Salvador, and it was partially caused by rioting during a FIFA Cup qualifying match. Next, note that the FIFA Cup is a soccer tournament, and soccer is a different sport from American football. Touchdowns are a scoring method specific to American football, not soccer. Therefore, since the Football War is associated with a soccer match, not an American football game, neither side would have scored a touchdown during the Football War. The answer is 'False'.",False
Are implants from an ORIF surgery affected by the magnetic field of the Earth?,"['An ORIF surgery is an Open Reduction Internal Fixation, done to fix broken bones.', 'Most hardware from ORIF surgeries is made of titanium.', 'Titanium is only slightly magnetic and does not affect metal detectors.']","First, consider the nature of implants used in ORIF surgeries: these implants are typically made of titanium. Next, understand the properties of titanium: it is only slightly magnetic and does not affect metal detectors. This indicates that titanium has minimal response to magnetic fields.

Therefore, the answer is 'No', the implants from an ORIF surgery are not affected by the magnetic field of the Earth.",False
Was Subway involved in a pedophilia scandal?,"['In 2000, Jared Fogle became a national spokesman for Subway after he lost a lot of weight eating only Subway sandwiches.', 'In 2015, Fogle was found guilty of child molestation and possession of child pornography, and Subway terminated its relationship with him.']","First, consider the timeline and events: In 2000, Jared Fogle became a national spokesman for Subway after losing a significant amount of weight by eating Subway sandwiches. However, in 2015, Fogle was found guilty of child molestation and possession of child pornography. Following this, Subway terminated its relationship with him. While Fogle's actions were criminal and reprehensible, they were personal and not directly related to Subway's business operations. Therefore, the scandal pertains to Jared Fogle personally, not Subway as a company. The answer is 'False' as the scandal was related to Jared Fogle, not Subway itself.",True

This indicates that the term is not viewed positively by the community it refers to. Additionally, Lady Gaga has faced online criticism for using the word 'Gypsy' in her song, which suggests that its use by non-Romani people can be controversial and offensive. Therefore, the use of the word 'Gypsy' by non-Romani people is not considered okay, as it can be disrespectful and derogatory towards the Romani community. The answer is 'False'.",False
Did Jack Dempsey have most title fight wins in either of his weight classes?,"['Jack Dempsey competed as a heavyweight and a lightheavyweight.', 'Jack Dempsey only had a handful of title defenses as heavyweight champion.', 'Wladimir Klitschko had 25 heavyweight title fight wins.', 'Jack Dempsey did not hold the lightheavyweight title.', 'Dariusz Michalczewski had 23 lightheavyweight title fight wins.']","First, consider the weight classes in which Jack Dempsey competed: heavyweight and lightheavyweight. Next, analyze his achievements in each class: Dempsey had a handful of title defenses as heavyweight champion, but did not hold the lightheavyweight title. Compare his record to other notable fighters in each class: Wladimir Klitschko had 25 heavyweight title fight wins, and Dariusz Michalczewski had 23 lightheavyweight title fight wins. Since Dempsey's number of title fight wins is not specified, but it is known that he had fewer heavyweight title defenses than Klitschko and no lightheavyweight title, it is unlikely that he had the most title fight wins in either of his weight classes.

Could Sugar Ray Robinson box if he stole in Iran?,"['Sugar Ray Robinson was an American boxer who relied on his fists to achieve 109 KO victories.', 'The penalty for stealing in Iran is having your hand cut off.', 'In August 2015 a prisoner in Iran, who was caught stealing, had his right hand and part of his left leg cut off.']","First, consider the context provided: Sugar Ray Robinson was an American boxer who achieved 109 KO victories, primarily using his fists. The penalty for stealing in Iran is severe, involving the amputation of a hand. Given that a prisoner in Iran had his right hand and part of his left leg cut off for stealing in 2015, it is clear that the punishment for theft is carried out. If Sugar Ray Robinson were to steal in Iran and face the legal consequences, he would likely have his hand(s) amputated, which would significantly impair his ability to box effectively. Therefore, the answer is 'False' because if Sugar Ray Robinson stole in Iran and faced the penalty, he would not be able to box as he did before.",False

Next, examine what Friendly's offers: a restaurant that serves dinner entrees and ice cream dishes, including several desserts with Reese's candy such as the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Sundae and Reese's Pieces Sundae. Given that E.T. has shown a fondness for Reese's Pieces, it is plausible that E.T. would enjoy the desserts at Friendly's that include this candy. Therefore, hypothetically, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial could love Friendly's due to the presence of desserts featuring Reese's Pieces. The answer is 'True'.",True
Does crucifixion violate US eighth amendment?,"['The eighth amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.', 'Crucifixion was particularly barbaric as people do not die instantly and live for several days.']","First, consider the definition of the US eighth amendment: it prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Next, examine the nature of crucifixion: it was a particularly barbaric form of execution where victims did not die instantly and could live for several days in extreme pain.

Therefore, it is uncertain whether Hattori Hanzō would admire Naruto, as their values and practices may differ significantly. The answer is 'Uncertain'.",False
Should you wrap a gift for a mother of a stillborn in stork wrapping paper?,"['Storks are used as a symbol of a new baby on the way.', 'Stillborn babies are those who are born lifeless.']","First, consider the symbolism associated with storks: they are commonly used as a symbol of a new baby on the way, representing birth and new beginnings. Next, understand the context of a stillborn baby: these are babies who are born lifeless, which is a tragic and sensitive situation for the parents. Given that stork wrapping paper is associated with the joy of new life, using it to wrap a gift for a mother of a stillborn could be seen as insensitive or inappropriate, as it might inadvertently remind her of her loss.

Next, examine the diet of eels: they prey on fish, worms, frogs, and lizards. Notice that lizards are a type of reptile, which is also part of the sand cat's diet. However, sand cats do not specifically avoid eating the prey of eels; their diets overlap in some areas (like lizards) but also differ in others (like insects and birds for sand cats, and fish and worms for eels). Therefore, the answer is 'False' because sand cats do not specifically avoid eating all of the prey of eels; their diets have some overlap but are not identical.",False

"When en route from China to France, must pilots know their altitude in the imperial foot?","['Most international airports and aviators use the foot to measure altitude ', 'China and North Korea require pilots to use meters for altitude', 'Pilots must communicate their altitude with local air traffic control ']","First, consider the context that most international airports and aviators use the foot to measure altitude. However, China and North Korea require pilots to use meters for altitude. When en route from China to France, pilots must communicate their altitude with local air traffic control. Since the departure country, China, requires the use of meters, pilots would likely need to know their altitude in meters while in Chinese airspace. Upon entering international airspace or upon approaching French airspace, where the foot is commonly used, pilots would then need to convert and communicate their altitude in feet. Therefore, while pilots do not need to know their altitude in imperial feet at all times during the flight, they must be able to convert and communicate in feet when necessary, especially when interacting with air traffic control in regions that use the imperial system. The answer is 'True'.",True

Since the gladiator games took place long before the invention of the shotgun, it is impossible for a gladiator to have killed his opponent with a shotgun. The answer is 'False'.",False
Could B be mistaken for an Arabic numeral?,"[""The letter 'B' resembles a figure-8 with a flattened left side."", ""The Arabic numeral '8' is drawn as one large circle and a smaller circle immediately on top, intersecting each other. "", ""A 'figure-8' is a shape consisting of two intersecting circles, the larger on the bottom.""]","First, consider the appearance of the letter 'B': it resembles a figure-8 with a flattened left side. Next, examine the appearance of the Arabic numeral '8': it is drawn as one large circle and a smaller circle immediately on top, intersecting each other. The figure-8 shape, which the letter 'B' resembles, is also a shape consisting of two intersecting circles, but typically with the larger circle on the bottom.

While the letter 'B' and the Arabic numeral '8' share a similar structure of two intersecting circles, the flattened left side of the 'B' and the specific arrangement of the circles in the Arabic numeral '8' are distinct. Therefore, although there is a resemblance, the letter 'B' is not identical to the Arabic numeral '8'. The answer is 'False'.",True
Would Immanuel Kant be disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement?,"['Immanuel Kant believed that Africans occupied the second lowest position on his racial hierarchy, below Whites and Asians.', 'The Black Lives Matter movement advocates for racial equality and anti-racism.']","First, consider Immanuel Kant's beliefs regarding race: he believed that Africans occupied the second lowest position on his racial hierarchy, which indicates a prejudiced view against people of African descent. Next, consider the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement: it advocates for racial equality and anti-racism, which directly opposes racial hierarchies and discrimination. Given Kant's historical views on race, it is likely that he would not support the principles of the Black Lives Matter movement and might even be disgusted by it due to his discriminatory beliefs.

Is an espresso likely to assuage fear?,"['Fear raises heart rate', 'Caffeine raises heart rate', 'Coffee may also increase symptoms such as jitteriness and nausea ']","First, consider the physiological effects of fear and espresso: fear raises heart rate, and caffeine, which is present in espresso, also raises heart rate. Additionally, coffee, including espresso, may increase symptoms such as jitteriness and nausea. Given that both fear and espresso have similar effects on the body, such as increasing heart rate and potentially causing discomfort, it is unlikely that an espresso would assuage fear. Instead, it might exacerbate the physical symptoms associated with fear. The answer is 'False'.",False
Is 500GB USB device enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day?,"['5 hours of Netflix programming uses up approximately 1 TB of data.', '1 TB is equal to 1000 GB of data.']","First, consider the data usage of Netflix shows: 5 hours of Netflix programming uses up approximately 1 TB of data. Next, convert the time of the shows to be saved: 10 hours of Netflix shows a day. Since 5 hours of Netflix programming uses 1 TB of data, 10 hours would use 2 TB of data (10 hours / 5 hours = 2; 2 * 1 TB = 2 TB). Now, convert 2 TB to GB: 2 TB is equal to 2000 GB (2 * 1000 GB = 2000 GB). Finally, compare this to the storage capacity of the USB device: a 500GB USB device. Since 2000 GB is significantly more than 500 GB, the answer is 'False'. A 500GB USB device is not enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.",False

""]","First, consider the cause of Heath Ledger's death: he accidentally overdosed on prescription medication, which led to his death. Next, examine the relationship between his work on The Dark Knight and his death. While it is known that Heath Ledger took his role as the Joker very seriously and it may have contributed to his stress and insomnia, which could have led to the use of prescription medication, the direct cause of his death was the accidental overdose, not his work on the film itself. Therefore, the death of Heath Ledger was not caused by his work on The Dark Knight, but rather by the accidental overdose of prescription medication. The answer is 'False'.",False
"Is ""A Tale of Two Cities"" a parody of the Bible?","['""A Tale of Two Cities"" is an original work by Charles Dickens.', 'The Bible is a religious text written down in the early centuries AD.', 'A parody is a deriative work intended to make fun of another piece of media. ']","First, consider the nature of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and the Bible: ""A Tale of Two Cities"" is an original work by Charles Dickens, while the Bible is a religious text written down in the early centuries AD. A parody is defined as a derivative work intended to make fun of another piece of media. There is no evidence or indication that ""A Tale of Two Cities"" was created with the intention of mocking or making fun of the Bible. Instead, it is a historical novel that explores themes of resurrection and sacrifice, which may have some thematic similarities to biblical stories but does not constitute a parody. Therefore, the answer is 'False'.",False

Tonsils are part of the immune system and help to prevent infection, but their removal does not make a person immune to all throat infections. Strep throat, a bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, can still occur in the throat of people without tonsils. Therefore, even though Rita Ora had her tonsils removed, she could still potentially contract strep throat. The answer is 'False' if the question implies that she is immune to strep throat post-surgery, but 'True' if the question is asking whether strep throat can occur in her throat post-surgery.",False

Conan the Barbarian is a comic book character typically equipped with a sword and does not wear armor, which is characteristic of a medieval or ancient setting. In contrast, Call of Duty is a modern warfare video game where soldiers are equipped with advanced firearms such as sniper rifles, shotguns, and machine guns. Given the stark contrast in weaponry and the technological advantage of the Call of Duty soldiers, it is highly likely that Conan the Barbarian would not last a long time in such a setting. His sword would be no match against the ranged and high-powered firearms used by the soldiers in Call of Duty. Therefore, the answer is 'True'.",True

Can an adult human skull hypothetically pass through the birth canal?,"['The largest baby ever born was 22 pounds. ', 'The average human skull weighs between 10 and 11 pounds.']","First, consider the size of the largest baby ever born, which was 22 pounds. Next, compare this to the average weight of a human skull, which is between 10 and 11 pounds. Although the largest baby was significantly larger than the average baby, the weight of the baby is not directly comparable to the size of the skull, as the skull is a solid structure and the baby includes soft tissues and fluids.

However, the human birth canal is designed to accommodate the passage of a baby's head, which is significantly smaller and more flexible than an adult human skull. The baby's skull bones are not fused, allowing for some overlap and compression during birth to fit through the birth canal. An adult human skull, with its fully fused bones and larger size, would not be able to compress or deform to pass through the birth canal.

Therefore, the answer is 'False'. An adult human skull cannot hypothetically pass through the birth canal due to its size and rigidity compared to the size and flexibility of a baby's head.",True

Will Communion be denied to Wednesday name origin followers?,"['Communion is the body and blood of Christ given out during mass.', 'Communion is only given to believers baptized in the Christian Church.', 'Wednesday comes from Old English Wodnesdaeg referring to Woden, also called Odin.', 'Odin was the pagan god of Norse mythology.', 'Vikings, believers in Norse mythology, clashed with Christians in Wessex and Northumbria for hundreds of years.']","First, consider the requirements for receiving Communion: it is given to believers who have been baptized in the Christian Church. Next, examine the context of ""Wednesday"" name origin followers: Wednesday comes from Old English Wodnesdaeg, referring to Woden (Odin), a pagan god of Norse mythology. Since these followers are associated with a pagan belief system, they are not typically part of the Christian faith, which is a requirement for receiving Communion. Therefore, Communion would likely be denied to Wednesday name origin followers as they do not meet the religious criteria for participation in this Christian sacrament. The answer is 'True'.",True

Can Darth Vader hypothetically outdunk Bill Walton without using The Force?,"['The Force allows a Jedi to move objects with their mind.', 'Darth Vader is 6\'2"" tall.', 'Former basketball player Bill Walton is a towering 6\'11"" tall.', 'The NBA basketball rim is 10 feet high.']","First, consider the physical attributes of Darth Vader and Bill Walton: Darth Vader is 6'2"" tall, while Bill Walton, a former basketball player, is 6'11"" tall. The NBA basketball rim is 10 feet high. To outdunk someone, one typically needs to have a combination of height, jumping ability, and athleticism. Given that Bill Walton is significantly taller and presumably has professional basketball skills, it would be challenging for Darth Vader, who is shorter and not known for his athletic prowess in basketball, to outdunk him without using The Force. The Force, as described, allows a Jedi to move objects with their mind, which could hypothetically assist in dunking a basketball. However, the question specifies that Darth Vader cannot use The Force. Therefore, based on their physical attributes and the requirement to not use The Force, it is unlikely that Darth Vader could hypothetically outdunk Bill Walton. The answer is 'False'.",False

Since 1996, they have released 5 studio albums, which have sold around a combined 14 million copies. While the hair change might have caused a divide in their fanbase, it is not directly correlated to the sales figures of their subsequent albums. The sales of their post-1996 albums are significantly lower than The Black Album, but this could be due to various factors such as market saturation, changes in music trends, or the natural evolution of a band's popularity over time. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that cutting their hair hurt their sales without considering other factors. The answer is 'Cannot be determined'.",True

Will AC/DC album sales buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's?,"['The B-52 bomber plane cost 60 million dollars in 2018.', 'AC/DC has sold over 200 million albums.', 'Lil Wayne has sold 120 million records worldwide.']","First, consider the cost of a B-52 bomber plane: it was $60 million in 2018. Next, compare the total album sales of AC/DC and Lil Wayne: AC/DC has sold over 200 million albums, while Lil Wayne has sold 120 million records worldwide. To determine which artist's sales could potentially buy more B-52 bombers, we need to calculate how many bombers each could afford based on their sales.

For AC/DC:
200 million albums * (unknown price per album) = total revenue
total revenue / $60 million (cost of one B-52 bomber) = number of bombers

For Lil Wayne:
120 million records * (unknown price per record) = total revenue
total revenue / $60 million (cost of one B-52 bomber) = number of bombers

Without knowing the exact revenue generated by each artist's album sales, we cannot definitively answer whether AC/DC's album sales would buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's. However, given that AC/DC has sold significantly more albums than Lil Wayne, it is likely that their sales would result in a higher total revenue, which could potentially allow them to buy more B-52 bombers.

In contrast, a slam dance is a type of dance in which leaping dancers collide against each other, often involving aggressive and high-impact movements. Given the differences in the physicality and the potential for injury, it is reasonable to conclude that the waltz is less injurious than slam dance due to its gentler and more controlled movements. The answer is 'True'.",True
Would a kindergarten teacher make a lesson of the New Testament?,"['The majority of Kindergarten teachers work in public schools.', 'Public schools abide by a separation of church and state, and do not have any overall religion.', 'Students of all religions are welcome to attend public school.']","First, consider the context: the majority of kindergarten teachers work in public schools, which abide by a separation of church and state and do not promote any specific religion. Additionally, public schools are open to students of all religions. Given these factors, a kindergarten teacher in a public school would not typically make a lesson of the New Testament, as it would conflict with the secular nature of public education and could potentially alienate students of different religious backgrounds.

Will Ronda Rousey hypothetically defeat X-Men's Colossus in a fight?,"['Ronda Rousey is a mixed martial artist and wrestler.', 'Ronda Rousey relies on striking moves and submission tactics to dominate her opponents.', ""X-Men's Colossus has the ability to change his appearance."", ""Colossus's mutation allows him to create an organic steel layer, that acts as an impenetrable external shell.""]","First, consider the abilities and skills of both Ronda Rousey and X-Men's Colossus. Ronda Rousey is a highly skilled mixed martial artist and wrestler, known for her striking moves and submission tactics. On the other hand, Colossus has a unique mutation that allows him to transform his body into an organic steel layer, making him virtually impenetrable.

Next, compare their strengths and weaknesses. Rousey's fighting techniques are effective against human opponents, but they may not be sufficient to penetrate Colossus's steel-like exterior. Colossus's ability to withstand physical attacks and his likely superior strength would give him a significant advantage in a fight against Rousey.

Based on these factors, it is unlikely that Ronda Rousey would hypothetically defeat X-Men's Colossus in a fight, as his unique abilities and defense would likely overpower her martial arts skills. The answer is 'False'.",False

Did Mike Tyson do something very different than McGruff's slogan to Evander Holyfield in 1997?,"['McGruff was an animated dog spokesman for the National Crime Prevention Council.', 'McGruff\'s slogan was, ""Take a bite out of crime.""', 'Mike Tyson was disqualified in a 1997 boxing bout against Evander Holyfield for taking a bite out of his ear.']","First, consider the context provided: McGruff's slogan is ""Take a bite out of crime,"" which is a metaphorical phrase encouraging crime prevention. Mike Tyson's action in 1997, where he bit Evander Holyfield's ear during a boxing match, was a literal interpretation of taking a bite, but in a violent and unsportsmanlike manner, leading to his disqualification. This action is very different from McGruff's slogan, which promotes non-violent crime prevention. Therefore, Mike Tyson did indeed do something very different than McGruff's slogan in his actions towards Evander Holyfield in 1997. The answer is 'True'.",False

Can French Defence initial move defend against four move checkmate?,"['The French Defence involves moving pawn in front of the queen forward two spaces.', 'The four move checkmate involves moving the queen and bishop to crowd the king.', 'The four move checkmate cannot be defended by pawn in front of queen.']","First, consider the initial moves of the French Defence and the four move checkmate. The French Defence involves moving the pawn in front of the queen forward two spaces (e.g., e6), while the four move checkmate involves a sequence of moves that typically starts with the opponent moving their king's pawn forward two spaces (e.g., e4). The key to the four move checkmate is the rapid development of the queen and bishop to attack the opponent's king before it can castle and develop adequate defenses.

Next, evaluate the effectiveness of the French Defence's initial move against the four move checkmate. The French Defence's pawn move (e6) does not directly address or defend against the queen and bishop's attack pattern that leads to the four move checkmate. The pawn move in the French Defence is more about controlling the center and preparing for a solid defensive setup, rather than specifically countering the aggressive tactics of the four move checkmate.

Therefore, the French Defence's initial move cannot effectively defend against the four move checkmate, as it does not directly counter the critical moves that lead to the checkmate scenario. The answer is 'False'.",False
